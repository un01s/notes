One way is to use SVG2shenzhen to create the KiCAD modules. Another way is Boldport PCBmode. Both use Inkscape to create SVG. The former is a kind of plugin for Inkscape. The latter is a part of interactive process using Python and has nothing to do with KiCAD. Boldport and Inkscape forms its own process.
Recently I noticed an OSHPark blog that mentioned another blog by Anne Barela from AdaFruit. The approach is different from the above. It uses AffinityDesigner, Gingerbread on Winterbloom, and KiCad. Basically it creates a KiCAD module designed by AffinityDesigner and transformed by Gingerbread.

On March 31, 2023 at online Bucha Summit, Secretary Blinken commented as follow: “One year ago today, when Ukrainian forces liberated Bucha, they discovered a massacre. Hundreds of men, women, and children killed indiscriminately by Russian forces.” So Blinken is talking about to hold Russia accountable for its war crime in Ukraine.

One is that “There is a lot of nudity in the film but no pornographic documentary quality; the camera does not linger, or move for the best view, or relish the spectacle of nudity. The result is some of the most poignant, almost sad, sex scenes I have ever seen - sensuous, yes, but bittersweet.” The other is about Kundera’s characters, “while his characters were making love they were sometimes distracted from the essentially tragic nature of their existence.” Of course we get the detachment of Tomas and the beauty and innocence of Tereza, and the feeling of deep nostalgia.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. – Soren Kierkegaard
[Man] is a specific organism of a specific nature that requires specific actions to sustain his life. . . . That which his survival requires is set by his nature and is not open to his choice. What is open to his choice is only whether he will discover it or not, whether he will choose the right goals and values or not. He is free to make the wrong choice, but not free to succeed with it. He is free to evade reality, he is free to unfocus his mind and stumble blindly down any road he pleases, but not free to avoid the abyss he refuses to see. . . . Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction.

Will both Israel and Palestine return to two-state solution?
When Russia invaded Ukraine, US stands with Ukraine. When Israel invaded Palestine, US stands with Israel. Hamas is a group of terrorists. That is not a question. But why had so many Palestinian civilians to be killed?

the speech from the dock in the Rivonia trial (1964) Long Walk to Freedom (1994) Why Mandela and his comrades decided to pursue sabotage and other forms of political voilence?
“I, and the others who started the organisation [Umkhonto], did so for two reasons. Firstly, we believed that as a result of Government policy, violence by the African people had become inevitable, and that unless responsible leadership was given to canalise and control the feelings of our people, there would be outbreaks of terrorism which would produce an intensity of bitterness and hostility between the various races of the country which is not produced even by war.
