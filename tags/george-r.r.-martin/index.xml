      <description>â€œI think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they&amp;rsquo;re going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there&amp;rsquo;s going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up.</description>
