      <description>We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.
A mind not to be changed by place or time. The mind is its own place, and in itself Can make a heav’n of hell, a hell of heav’n. John Milton (1608-1674), Paradise Lost In books we never find anything but ourselves. Strangely enough, that always gives us great pleasure, and we say the author is a genius.</description>

      <description>Hell is empty and all the devils are here. William Shakespeare, The Tempest Some believe it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love. J.R.R.Tolkien, The Hobbit, 1937.
But imprint this on your mind: tolerance becomes a crime when applied to evil.</description>
