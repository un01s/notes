      <description>Mayakovsky BY FRANK O&amp;#39;HARA 1 My heart’s aflutter! I am standing in the bath tub crying. Mother, mother who am I? If he will just come back once and kiss me on the face his coarse hair brush my temple, it’s throbbing! then I can put on my clothes I guess, and walk the streets. 2 I love you. I love you, but I’m turning to my verses and my heart is closing like a fist.</description>

I hear my country in your voice From Romeo Oriogun:</description>
