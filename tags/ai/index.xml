&lt;p&gt;Albert Camus: &lt;strong&gt;Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;peter-coviello-maybe-don&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lithub.com/maybe-dont-talk-to-the-new-york-times-about-zohran-mamdani/&#34;&gt;Peter Coviello: Maybe don&amp;rsquo;t talk to the New York Times about Zohran Mamdani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time I’ve been saying that the storied choice between socialism and barbarism was made exquisitely clear a good many years ago in the United States, and both major parties chose barbarism. They are obviously and consequentially different barbarisms — one had reproductive freedom, vaccines, and trans health care in it, at least for a while — and I can tell you why I have sincerely preferred one to the other. But we oughtn’t to kid ourselves. From the perspective of a world of increasingly unimaginable maldistribution of resources, cascading ecological collapse, a genocide cheered on by a putatively liberal order, &lt;strong&gt;both are barbarisms.&lt;/strong&gt; Mamdani seemed to me a small glimmering break in the wall of all that.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;water-bottle&#34;&gt;water-bottle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a library. Put my water bottle on the foutain stand and went into the restroom. Upon returning, my water bottle was gone. While I have left it this way many many times, the water bottle always stays there without leaving. Where is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went outside and saw a man leaving. Ran to him and saw my water bottle in his hand. &amp;ldquo;Excuse me, that water bottle is mine.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, I thought somebody lost it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
