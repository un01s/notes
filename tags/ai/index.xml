&lt;h3 id=&#34;water-bottle&#34;&gt;water-bottle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a library. Put my water bottle on the foutain stand and went into the restroom. Upon returning, my water bottle was gone. While I have left it this way many many times, the water bottle always stays there without leaving. Where is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went outside and saw a man leaving. Ran to him and saw my water bottle in his hand. &amp;ldquo;Excuse me, that water bottle is mine.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, I thought somebody lost it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
