      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;cheese-bread&#34;&gt;cheese bread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made some cheese bread. the dough has a bit of cheese. the crust is thin with olive oil applied at the top. A little salt to add favor. Then a layer of cheese on the top. Bake it to golden top. You have a crusty top and edge with layered and soft internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cem-karsan-on-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Cem Karsan on market volatility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He build his models to profit on the volatility of the market. I am not sure I understand all his points. But I agree that the fundamental structre of the market, the human nature and the season of the year drive the volatility. The election, the interest rate, the wars and many other events and data just change the direction of the flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
