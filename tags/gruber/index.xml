      <description>Read a story from Daring Fireball. The story has two parts. The first half is about his mother&amp;rsquo;s death starting from May this year. The second half is about his father and his wedding ring. The whole story adds flavor with this election. You know, Bob Gruber, his father is an optimist at heart.
