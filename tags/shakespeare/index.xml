      <description>Hell is empty and all the devils are here. William Shakespeare, The Tempest Some believe it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love. J.R.R.Tolkien, The Hobbit, 1937.
But imprint this on your mind: tolerance becomes a crime when applied to evil.</description>

      <description>We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</description>
