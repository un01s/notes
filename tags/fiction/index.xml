      <description>Fiction, like all art, is primarily an emotional endeavour, and it succeeds or fails on the basis of its emotional sense.
The past is a canon we are all entangled with. Whether we know it or not, our combined human history is the reference we all share, and it is emotionally complex beyond any corpus of texts imaginable. Of course structural powers and systemic forces matter, of course political systems and expediencies matter, but power is concentrated in individuals, and individuals have emotional histories.</description>
