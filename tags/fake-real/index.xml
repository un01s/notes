      <description>Business owners spend more time printing business cards than finding clients. People trying to get in shape who buy fancy workout gear instead of exercising. Pretend activity instead of the real thing.
Ask questions and find the real pain and problems to solve.
Real things have risk. They have the possibility of failure. They have frustration. They force you to confront the possibility that maybe you just arenâ€™t good enough. Fake activity is great for making yourself feel better, but lousy for actual results.</description>
