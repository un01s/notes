      <description>Aaron and Gaza Last Sunday, Airman Aaron Bushnell set himself on fire by Israeli Embassy in D.C. to protest US involvement in Gaza genocide. He died later after being transported to a local hospital on Sunday afternoon. What are we doing to stop the Gaza war?
&amp;ldquo;My name is Aaron Bushnell, I am an active-duty member of the United States Air Force and I will no longer be complicit in genocide,&amp;rdquo; he says in a video of the incident.</description>

      <description>For someone my age who was in the civil rights movement, and in other struggles of the 1960s, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen miracles happen. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ordinary people do the most heroic things.

I’ve always been influenced by the poems Brecht wrote in the late 30s, during the Second World War, after everything had been incinerated, all the dreams and values of an entire generation destroyed, and Brecht said, well, it’s a new dark ages … how do people resist in the dark ages?</description>
