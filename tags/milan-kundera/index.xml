      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Roger Ebert commented on the film of 1988 directed by Philip Kaufman, there are two things standing out. One is that &amp;ldquo;There is a lot of nudity in the film but no pornographic documentary quality; the camera does not linger, or move for the best view, or relish the spectacle of nudity. The result is some of the most poignant, almost sad, sex scenes I have ever seen - sensuous, yes, but bittersweet.&amp;rdquo; The other is about Kundera&amp;rsquo;s characters, &amp;ldquo;while his characters were making love they were sometimes distracted from the essentially tragic nature of their existence.&amp;rdquo; Of course we get the detachment of Tomas and the beauty and innocence of Tereza, and the feeling of deep nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
