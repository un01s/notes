      <description>Each of us has a window, that is ourselves. If we sample fast enough according to Nyquist-Shannon&amp;rsquo;s sampling theorem, we may reconstruct the world viewed through this window. Most of time, our views are just partial and approximate. It&amp;rsquo;s not so even because we are not fast enough and long enough.
It&amp;#39;s in vain to recall the past, unless it works some influence upon the present. -- Charles Dickens. David Copperfield There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.</description>
