      <description>An excerpt from Deleuze on Godard.
I can tell you how I think of Godard. He&amp;#39;s a man who works very hard, and it follows that he is completely alone. But this loneliness is not the common sort: it&amp;#39;s filled by a huge assortment of things. Not dreams, fantasies or projects, but actions, things and even people. It is a many-faceted, creative loneliness. It&amp;#39;s what lies behind Godard&amp;#39;s ability to operate powerfully on his own, but also as part of a team.</description>
