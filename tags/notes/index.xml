      <description>â€œAnd they laughed a little and were very friendly together, the three of them, Anna, Emanuele and Giustino; and they were pleased to be together, the three of them, thinking of all those who were dead, and of the long war and the sorrow and noise and confusion, and of the long, difficult life which they saw in front of them now, full of all the things they did not know how to do.</description>

      <description>Life is nothing but a lightning between darkness. Without the words, we can feel the world. This world close to you and within your touch is vorld. To live is just experiencing the vorld. Each vorld is within the world, independent or dependent, with or without overlapping.
We see the vorld and feel the vorld. We long to know more about the world beyond our senses. We create tools like telescope, microscope, oscilloscope, electroscope to extend our sight.</description>
