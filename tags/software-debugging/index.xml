      <description>Today Adam Wolff tweeted a story about deugging FB-Chat. He is a technical fellow at Electric Capital. Below is it.
Before the major effort to redo the UI, FB Chat was super broken and we had no idea why.
We didnâ€™t know what was wrong, but we knew the code was a mess. We set about rewriting both the front-end and the back-end in an effort to fix it.
The front-end rewrite pulled in a whole team of amazing engineers and became one of the big threads that led to reactjs.</description>
