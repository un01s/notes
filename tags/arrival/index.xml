      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10pm July 2 (Local Time) &lt;a href=&#34;map.baidu.com&#34;&gt;百度地图&lt;/a&gt;和&lt;a href=&#34;bing.com&#34;&gt;必应&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 11-hour cross-pacific from Vancouver to Seoul,then 5-hour to connect, 3-hour to fly, landing around 1150am,home around 0230pm finally, the trip of 19 hours (or 26 hours) was finally done. The worst beer experience, sweating and catching a cold in the on-off sleep during flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a simple late lunch or early dinner around 3pm, then a shower, sleep at 6pm and wake up around 0930pm. Jet-lagging is obvious. How the city is so noisy and everyone seems OK with it? From my window, almost every house has their window open. At night the noise seems the same as day. Or there is no day or night, people is always busy. My brother has to work to 10pm because of my interruption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
