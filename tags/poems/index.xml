      <description>The new US congress is still voting for its next speaker. From former speaker John Boehner, &amp;ldquo;What they&amp;rsquo;re really interested in is chaos. &amp;hellip;They want to throw sand in the gears of the hated federal government until it fails and they&amp;rsquo;ve finally proved that it&amp;rsquo;s beyond saving. Every time they vote down a bill, they get another invitation to go on Fox News or talk radio. It&amp;rsquo;s a narcissistic &amp;ndash; and dangerous &amp;ndash; feedback loop.</description>

      <description>Piano by Edgar Kunz I held him together as long as I could, she says.
He stopped working, stopped coming upstairs.
He was like tissue paper coming apart in water.
Like smoke in my hands. It had nothing to do
with you, baby. You left when you had to.
I met a woman once who worked on pianos.
Said it was a hard job. The tools, the leverage.
The required ear.</description>
