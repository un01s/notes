      <description>Piano by Edgar Kunz I held him together as long as I could, she says.
He stopped working, stopped coming upstairs.
He was like tissue paper coming apart in water.
Like smoke in my hands. It had nothing to do
with you, baby. You left when you had to.
I met a woman once who worked on pianos.
Said it was a hard job. The tools, the leverage.
The required ear.</description>
