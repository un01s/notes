      <description>A river runs through it by Norman Maclean
Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise.</description>

      <description>Call me Chihiro I watched a show, Call me chihiro. This reminds me of the opening sentence of Moby Dick, Call me Ishmael. I like it.
Chihiro&amp;rsquo;s ex-boss opened a shop of tropical fish. Chihiro thought he&amp;rsquo;s kind of her father. When I was in Singapore, somehow I&amp;rsquo;d like to visit Spain, Mexico or Argentina. I love that kind of passionate songs, dances, lives and spanish language. There is some happiness deep down there.</description>
