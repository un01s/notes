      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some excerpts from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.experimental-history.com/p/28-slightly-rude-notes-on-writing&#34;&gt;28 slightly rude notes on writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worked in the Writing Center in college, and whenever a student came in with an essay, we were supposed to make sure it had two things: an argument (“thesis”) and a reason to make that argument (“motive”). Everybody understood what a “thesis” is, whether or not they actually had one. But nobody understood “motive”. If I asked a student why they wrote the essay in front of them, they’d look at me funny. “Because I had to,” they’d say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most writing is bad because it’s missing a motive. It feels dead because it hasn’t found its reason to live. You can’t accomplish a goal without having one in the first place—writing without a motive is like declaring war on no one in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
