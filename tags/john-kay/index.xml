      <description>this is a good piece of advice for investment. it was written in November 2014 by Jason Zweig. I was once asked, at a journalism conference, how I defined my job. I said: My job is to write the exact same thing between 50 and 100 times a year in such a way that neither my editors nor my readers will ever think I am repeating myself.
Thatâ€™s because good advice rarely changes, while markets change constantly.</description>
