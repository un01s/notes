&lt;p&gt;John W. Gardner was the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Lyndon Johnson, an activist and author, and recipient of the 1964 Presidential Medal of Freedom. This speech was delivered to McKinsey &amp;amp; Company on November 10, 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech Transcript&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to talk about “Self-Renewal.” One of your most fundamental tasks is the renewal of the organizations you serve, and that usually includes persuading the top officers to accomplish a certain amount of self-renewal. But to help you think about others is not my primary mission this morning. I want to help you think about yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
