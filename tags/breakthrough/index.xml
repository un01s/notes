      <description>As we became more experienced, it&amp;rsquo;s harder to get or feel a breakthrough. However, once you get it, it is so exciting. The context here is that I am thinking about Buddhism for quite a long time (心外无别法). Then when you connect it with philosophy, say German idealists such as Kant and Hegel, it becomes clear that our ideas and minds is very important to shape and understand the reality. This has no conflict with scientific truth from materialism.</description>
