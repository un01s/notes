      <description>The book of disquiet is a great book, unique in its own way.
To write is to forget. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life. Music soothes, the visual arts exhilarates, the performing arts (such as acting and dance) entertain. Literature, however, retreats from life by turning in into slumber. The other arts make no such retreatâ€” some because they use visible and hence vital formulas, others because they live from human life itself.</description>
