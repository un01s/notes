      <description>Nature, is parts without a whole. When I read this line, it is like a lightning strike. For each of us, there are some universial patterns of our experiece in this world. However, it is each of us that makes the whole, loosely connected and remotely located. Yes, there is no such a whole. No one could experience everything in this universe.
Read the excerpt of this poem, the keeper of sheep, by Fernando Pessoa.</description>

      <description>The book of disquiet is a great book, unique in its own way.
To write is to forget. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life. Music soothes, the visual arts exhilarates, the performing arts (such as acting and dance) entertain. Literature, however, retreats from life by turning in into slumber. The other arts make no such retreatâ€” some because they use visible and hence vital formulas, others because they live from human life itself.</description>
