      <description>The Rolling Stones has a song, You can&amp;rsquo;t always get what you want. It simply tells us that no matter how much we yearn it we can&amp;rsquo;t always get it. The angst and the pain we have to go through, it is real. It shows us what we are not who we are. It should help us to puncture the illusion we have about who we are supposed to be. It should wake up the dreams we are in like Shakespeare said, &amp;ldquo;We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep.</description>
