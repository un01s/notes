      <description>Two mini-stories: water-bottle In a library. Put my water bottle on the foutain stand and went into the restroom. Upon returning, my water bottle was gone. While I have left it this way many many times, the water bottle always stays there without leaving. Where is it?
I went outside and saw a man leaving. Ran to him and saw my water bottle in his hand. &amp;ldquo;Excuse me, that water bottle is mine.</description>
