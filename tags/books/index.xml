      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-crime-and-punishment&#34;&gt;Book: Crime and Punishment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-welcome-to-the-hyunam-dong-bookshop&#34;&gt;Book: Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&amp;lt;..&amp;gt; Reading makes you see with clearer eyes and understand the world better. When you do that , you become stronger - the feeling you associate with success. But at the same time with pain. Within the pages, there&amp;rsquo;s much suffering, beyond that we&amp;rsquo;ve gone through in our finite experience of life. You&amp;rsquo;ll read about suffering you didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed. Having experienced their pain through words, it becomes a lot harder to focus on pursuing individual happiness and success. Reading makes you deviate further from the textbook definition of success because books don&amp;rsquo;t make us go ahead of or above anyone else; they guide us to stand alongside others. &amp;lt;&amp;hellip;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
