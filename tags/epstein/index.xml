      <description>This is from Adam Davidson.
I spent two years working on the Jeffrey Epstein podcast, Broken. I became close with many of his victims and learned a lot of stuff that&amp;ndash;for annoying legal reasons&amp;ndash;we can&amp;rsquo;t publish.
That experience has fundamentally reshaped how I see the world.
TL;DR: I knew that rich and powerful men can get away with a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize just how much they can get away with and just how much the entire system&amp;ndash;courts, journalism, prosecutors&amp;ndash;works inadvertently and deliberately, to reinforce their impunity.</description>
