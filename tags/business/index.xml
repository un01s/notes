      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just come across the tweets from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/marcepntoja&#34;&gt;Marcelino Pantoja&lt;/a&gt;. Feel something with the followings. One is that Steve Jobs on building a real company. The other is that Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman on competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficult thing to start a business is what to build, what is the feature of a product you really want but can&amp;rsquo;t find. But that&amp;rsquo;s not enough. How can you expand your product into a platform with that particular product. It may start with a niche product. In the end, it may be a platform with your products that everyone uses. If you have a right product, sooner or later you will move to the top. If your product is right, there is no competitons that could win from you. Your products will conquer your competitions. Just remember this: to win a war without fighting is the art. Put out your products there to break the will of others to fight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
