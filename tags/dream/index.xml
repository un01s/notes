      <description>In a song by Horslips, you can&amp;rsquo;t fool the beast, there are a few lines interesting.
Ah yes, they&amp;#39;re blind already. They&amp;#39;re blind to love, blind to pain, Blind to hope, blind to gain. Ah you can fool them alright But can you fool the beast? Love Poem by Robert Bly:
When we are in love, we love the grass And the barns, and the light poles And the small mainstreet abandoned all nights.</description>

      <description>Call me Chihiro I watched a show, Call me chihiro. This reminds me of the opening sentence of Moby Dick, Call me Ishmael. I like it.
Chihiro&amp;rsquo;s ex-boss opened a shop of tropical fish. Chihiro thought he&amp;rsquo;s kind of her father. When I was in Singapore, somehow I&amp;rsquo;d like to visit Spain, Mexico or Argentina. I love that kind of passionate songs, dances, lives and spanish language. There is some happiness deep down there.</description>
