      <description>The Rolling Stones has a song, You can&amp;rsquo;t always get what you want. It simply tells us that no matter how much we yearn it we can&amp;rsquo;t always get it. The angst and the pain we have to go through, it is real. It shows us what we are not who we are. It should help us to puncture the illusion we have about who we are supposed to be. It should wake up the dreams we are in like Shakespeare said, &amp;ldquo;We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep.</description>

      <description>We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</description>

      <description>In a song by Horslips, you can&amp;rsquo;t fool the beast, there are a few lines interesting.
Ah yes, they&amp;#39;re blind already. They&amp;#39;re blind to love, blind to pain, Blind to hope, blind to gain. Ah you can fool them alright But can you fool the beast? Love Poem by Robert Bly:
When we are in love, we love the grass And the barns, and the light poles And the small mainstreet abandoned all nights.</description>

      <description>Call me Chihiro I watched a show, Call me chihiro. This reminds me of the opening sentence of Moby Dick, Call me Ishmael. I like it.
Chihiro&amp;rsquo;s ex-boss opened a shop of tropical fish. Chihiro thought he&amp;rsquo;s kind of her father. When I was in Singapore, somehow I&amp;rsquo;d like to visit Spain, Mexico or Argentina. I love that kind of passionate songs, dances, lives and spanish language. There is some happiness deep down there.</description>
