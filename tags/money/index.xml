      <description>Came across several quotes from Henry Ford:
Money doesn’t change men, it merely unmasks them. If a man is naturally selfish or arrogant or greedy, the money brings that out.
Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly. It comes as a by-product of providing a useful service.
The best way to make money is to stop thinking about making money and start thinking about serving people.
The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.</description>

      <description>First, an interesting book is coming, The dream you ordered is sold out what if money expired? There is an interesting article on money. Below are some notes.
Bartering is inconvenient because it requires “double coincidence of wants.” This makes it highly inefficient too.
As it evolved, money became increasingly symbolic. Money is abstract. It’s a belief system, a language, a social contract. Money is trust. But the rules aren’t written in stone.</description>
