      <description>From the start of COVID-19 pandemic, there are a lot of things happened. Wars are still raging including both Ukraine and Gaza. BLM protests around the world happend after George Floyd was choked to death. During this period, many notable leftists turned right. It is like a deconstruction process. Then I start to read James Baldwin and Hannah Arendt like unlearning or deprogramming.
Just imagine that you had lived and grown in a different place or time, read different books, you might have different expereinces and beliefs.</description>
