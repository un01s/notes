For example, in the web, REST APIs use the HTTP protocol and its methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE …) to communicate. A request message may contain a header, a body and a response status. Inside the header, there is a field of Content-Type that specifies the message format such as JSON, XML, Protobuf, etc. Serialization is a process that turns a data structure into a sequence of bytes that can be transmitted.\nwhy JSON is so popular?\nhuman readable perfectly integrated into the web flexible tools everywhere With JSON, you often send ambiguous or non-guaranteed data. you may encounter a missing field, an incorrect type, a typo in a key, or simply an undocumented structure. With Protobuf, that’s impossible.\nsyntax = \"proto3\"; message User { int32 id = 1; string name = 2; string email = 3; bool isActive = 4; } Each field has a strict type, a number identifier, and a stable name.\ncode generation for protobuf protoc --dart_out=lib user.proto final user = User() ..id = 42 ..name = \"Alice\" ..email = \"alice@example.com\" ..isActive = true; final bytes = user.writeToBuffer(); // Binary serialization final sameUser = User.fromBuffer(bytes); // Deserialization It works with Dart, TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift, C#, Go, Rust, and many more. no manual validation required.\nAnother strength of Protobuf is that it’s a binary format.

After some of his severest setbacks he has been able to get his immediate associates together and begin making plans for a “come-back”. Events which would crush most individuals, at least temporarily, seem to act as stimulants to greater efforts in Hitler.\nword and writing cut But it cut him, all the same, to see one of his own so upset by the sight of what other children craved and he could not help but wonder if she’d be brave enough or able for what the world had in store. – Claire Keegan, Small things like these\nbite Positano bites deep.

Press\nthe last useful man the distinction between know of and know how. One can’t help but imagine the 20th-century philosophers Gilbert Ryle and Maurice Merleau-Ponty watching on proudly as a new generation takes up the work of undoing Cartesian dualism, the separation of mind and body they both saw as the original sin of analytic philosophy.\nIt was Ryle who, in 1945, formulated the distinction that runs through Cruise’s films: that between knowledge of and knowledge how. The former was propositional, the sort you can articulate in neat, explicit statements. The latter was practical aptitude, the kind only revealed by competent action. Crucially, you can possess the latter without the former; knowing how does not entail being able to explain it. Donloe, crouched over a live nuclear bomb in Final Reckoning, gives the idea its best cinematic gloss. “Where’d you learn to do this?” asks his colleague, watching nervously. “Never said I did,” he replies.\nIn 1945, Maurice Merleau-Ponty also published The Phenomenology of Perception, in which he put forward an even simpler argument: to draw any distinction between consciousness and body is nonsensical. For Merleau-Ponty, the body was not a mere vessel for the mind but a repertoire of skills built and refined through contact with the world, an inescapable part of all human thought. His thinking directly shaped the “Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition,” a five-stage framework for how adults progress from novice to expert, still taught everywhere from NHS wards to U.S. Air Force flight schools. I do, therefore I am. No wonder Cruise is addressed, jarringly, as “mister” six times in the film.\nIn 1945, Maurice Merleau-Ponty also published The Phenomenology of Perception, in which he put forward an even simpler argument: to draw any distinction between consciousness and body is nonsensical.

The former was propositional, the sort you can articulate in neat, explicit statements. The latter was practical aptitude, the kind only revealed by competent action. Crucially, you can possess the latter without the former; knowing how does not entail being able to explain it. Donloe, crouched over a live nuclear bomb in Final Reckoning, gives the idea its best cinematic gloss. “Where’d you learn to do this?” asks his colleague, watching nervously. “Never said I did,” he replies.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In 1945, Maurice Merleau-Ponty also published The Phenomenology of Perception, in which he put forward an even simpler argument: to draw any distinction between consciousness and body is nonsensical. For Merleau-Ponty, the body was not a mere vessel for the mind but a repertoire of skills built and refined through contact with the world, an inescapable part of all human thought. His thinking directly shaped the “Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition,” a five-stage framework for how adults progress from novice to expert, still taught everywhere from NHS wards to U.S. Air Force flight schools. I do, therefore I am. No wonder Cruise is addressed, jarringly, as “mister” six times in the film.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In 1945, Maurice Merleau-Ponty also published <ins>The Phenomenology of Perception</ins>, in which he put forward an even simpler argument: to draw any distinction between consciousness and body is nonsensical.
