A CFG is a graph that represents the control flow of a program. Nodes in the CFG represent basic blocks (sequences of instructions that execute sequentially without branches), and edges represent the possible execution paths between those blocks.

That’s because good advice rarely changes, while markets change constantly. The temptation to pander is almost irresistible. And while people need good advice, what they want is advice that sounds good.

How to get it right? Here are two pieces of advice. One is from the Gmail creator Paul Buchheit.
What’s the right approach to new products? Pick three key attributes or features, get those things very, very right, and then forget about everything else. Those three attributes define the fundamental essence and value of the product – the rest is noise. For example, the original iPod was: 1) small enough to fit in your pocket, 2) had enough storage to hold many hours of music and 3) easy to sync with your Mac (most hardware companies can’t make software, so I bet the others got this wrong). That’s it – no wireless, no ability to edit playlists on the device, no support for Ogg – nothing but the essentials, well executed.

Speech Transcript
I’m going to talk about “Self-Renewal.” One of your most fundamental tasks is the renewal of the organizations you serve, and that usually includes persuading the top officers to accomplish a certain amount of self-renewal. But to help you think about others is not my primary mission this morning. I want to help you think about yourselves.

Pursuing elegance in a vacuum leads to abandoned side projects or frameworks nobody uses. By contrast, clunky but functional code often comes with just the right compromises for quick iteration. And that in turn means a lot of messy code powers products that people love — something that’s a far bigger challenge.
Are you shipping a product and racing to meet user needs? Or are you building a reusable library or framework meant to stand the test of time?

It started in energy, commodities and services. The company filed for bankruptcy on Dec 2, 2001 while employing about 20,600 staff with a revenue of $100B in 2000. Enron scandal was the biggest audit failure.
John Arnold was born in 1974 and growed up in Dallas Texas. He graduated in 1995 from Vanderbilt University with a degree in math and economics. He was former Enron executive. He made three quarters of a billion dollars for Enron in 2001 and was awarded a bonus of $8 million. His firm, Centaurus Advisors, LLC, was a Houston-based hedge fund specializing in trading energy products that closed in 2012.

The job of fund managers is to ensure that giant pile of money grows. At the lowest end, it needs to grow in line with inflation, 9% annually in US for example.
VC is spread-betting across a large number of startuos. They are trying to deploy a fund into a set of startups that matches their hopes, dreams and ambitions. Ultimately, there are just two goals. The lowest possible goal is to return the fund.

Click the image submits the form with two query parameters included: ?x=32&amp;y=48. Using CSRF tokens, the server knows where it put your open circle.
Other sites implement the Captcha in other creative ways. One uses an &lt;input type="range"> to position an image to the correct place.
The most impressive one uses a series of checkboxes positioned in the exact same place. When a checkbox is checked, that box is hidden and the next one is shown. Based on what box is checked, images are repositioned with CSS. You then type the parts of the URL that have stars covering them in the scrambled image — another anti-phishing strategy.
