I walked, hearing the wind in the trees, feeling the cold against my skin, but what I dwelled on were the stars blazing in the immense arc of sky. Jessica, it is so much easier to think of our lives, as we move under the brief luster of leaves, loving what we have, than to think of how it is such small beings as we travel in the dark with no visible way or end in sight. Yet there were times I remember under the same sky when the body's bones became light and the wound of the skull opened to receive the cold rays of the cosmos, and were, for an instant, themselves the cosmos, there were times when I could believe we were the children of stars and our words were made of the same dust that flames in space, times when I could feel in the lightness of breath the weight of a whole day come to rest. But tonight it is different. Afraid of the dark in which we drift or vanish altogether, I imagine a light that would not let us stray too far apart, a secret moon or mirror, a sheet of paper, something you could carry in the dark when I am away.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-12-15 09:15:35 -0700 -0700'>December 15, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>2 min</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>un01s</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 20241215" href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20241215/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>small poem</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>John O’Donohue Fluent I would love to live Like a river flows, Carried by the surprise Of its own unfolding.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-12-08 18:44:08 -0700 -0700'>December 8, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>1 min</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>un01s</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to small poem" href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20241208/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>20241130</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

Cem Karsan on market volatility He build his models to profit on the volatility of the market. I am not sure I understand all his points. But I agree that the fundamental structre of the market, the human nature and the season of the year drive the volatility. The election, the interest rate, the wars and many other events and data just change the direction of the flow.

However, once you get it, it is so exciting. The context here is that I am thinking about Buddhism for quite a long time (心外无别法). Then when you connect it with philosophy, say German idealists such as Kant and Hegel, it becomes clear that our ideas and minds is very important to shape and understand the reality. This has no conflict with scientific truth from materialism. In human world, you have to accept and be open to that there are more than one ultimate truth.

German idealists: Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel further developed this idea, using dialectics to delve into the nature of being and knowledge itself. Hegel’s dialectic, in particular, is famous for its thesis-antithesis-synthesis progression.
Thesis: A proposition or an idea is put forward, starting the dialectical process. Antithesis: This initial idea is then countered with an opposing view or critique. Synthesis: Through the clash of thesis and antithesis, a new understanding (the synthesis) emerges, which in turn becomes a new thesis for further exploration. This triadic structure is not just a rigid formula; it’s a dynamic process that promotes the evolution of thought. It’s been applied in philosophy, sociology, literature, and even in everyday problem-solving.
