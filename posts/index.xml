      <description>Went hiking to a nearby park. Bit cold and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty soon that my face was numbed. Birds sang their morning songs with no stop. On the top, the white peaks of rocky mountians in the west are clear to see. But no one to see but birds.
Memory is clearly somewhere in our brain. When we remember something, it&amp;rsquo;s somehow printed hard there. If you practise, anything like jogging, swimming, basketball, guitar, violin, or piano, you know how the muscle memory is there.</description>

      <description>I still do not know what is the best way to say goodbye. I hate it. So all the time, I evaded them because they were sad. Upon graduation, I did not send my friends off. Leaving my hometown, I left alone. No one taught me, I just tried it out slowly as life moves on. I have so many things to say. But where to start?</description>

      <description>Double standard is everywhere in our life. The difference between I and others. The difference between my family and others. The difference between my people and others.
President Zelensky is leading a fight not only for defending Ukraine but the freedom of western values. He is a hero. But if we are serious, we have to deal with the double standard. Besides Kyiv, how about other cities like Baghdad, or Kabul?</description>

      <description>At the age of 93, Chomsky told us, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re approaching the most dangerous point in human history &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s monstrous for Ukraine.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It’s certainly right to have moral outrage about Putin’s actions in Ukraine,” he said of Biden’s recent declaration that the Russian president “cannot remain in power”. “But it would be even more progress to have moral outrage about other horrible atrocities… In Afghanistan, literally millions of people are facing imminent starvation.</description>

      <title>What is Freud&#39;s single greatest contribution?</title>

      <description>Freud already answered this question, of course, when he said that whereas Darwin decentered the human animal from the apex of creation, Copernicus decentered the earth from the center of the universe, Freud had decentered humanity in itself. No longer was the human immanent.
Lacan&amp;rsquo;s answer is perhaps even better: &amp;ldquo;That is why the unconscious was invented—so that we would realize that man&amp;rsquo;s desire is the Other&amp;rsquo;s desire, and that love, while it is a passion that involves ignorance of desire, nevertheless leaves desire its whole import&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Here are some C code with the JavaScript quirks. Credits to luna.
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; int main() { puts(&amp;#34;-0.5&amp;#34; + 1); printf(&amp;#34;%d\n&amp;#34;, 50 ** &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;); return 0; } To build and run the above code, just do the following and ignore the warnings.
$ gcc c-js.c &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./a.out 0.5 2500 Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the warnings first.
c-js.c:4:15: warning: adding &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; to a string does not append to the string [-Wstring-plus-int] puts(&amp;#34;-0.5&amp;#34; + 1); ~~~~~~~^~~ c-js.</description>
