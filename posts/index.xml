      <description>Kant has four big questions for philosophy.
 What can I know? How should I act? For what can I hope? What is the human being?  This writing has something to do with Kant&amp;rsquo;s last question.
In the book of &amp;ldquo;Last Chance to See&amp;rdquo;, Douglas Adams told an anecdote about the Golden Pavilion Temple in Kyoto.
&amp;ldquo;I remembered once, in Japan, having been to see the Gold Pavilion Temple in Kyoto and being mildly surprised at quite how well it had weathered the passage of time sicne it was first built in the fourteenth century.</description>

      <title>自然属性与道德</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Moral worth should be judged not in terms of the naturalness of a trait, but rather in terms of how that trait impacts the wellbeing of everyone affected by it. Thus, violence is natural but bad, medicine unnatural but good.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ndash; Steve Stewart-Williams, The Ape that Understood the Universe
道德与否不应该以某一属性是否自然为依据，而是应该以该属性是否会影响所有人的福祉为据。正因为如此，暴力是自然的却是不对的，医药是非自然的却是好的。</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The battle to feed all of humanity is over.&amp;rdquo; This is the first line of Paul Ehrlich&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;The Population Bomb&amp;rsquo;, published in 1968. The book sold millions of copies and was taken very seriously.
The Malthus&amp;rsquo;s prediction of what is now called Malthusian trap. That is more an observation of the cyclical patterns of population boom and bust that had happened for most of human existence. The the industrial revolution changed things at some great costs.</description>

      <title>Why France and German behave so?</title>

      <description>今天的法国总统马克龙和德国总理舒尔茨很像1938年二战之前的英国首相张伯伦和法国总理达拉第，慕尼黑协定将捷克的苏台德割让给德国并没有带来一厢情愿的和平，只是揭开了二战的序幕。
“尽管试着将这种方式称为谈判，但绥靖的味道却难也遮掩。1938年张伯伦和达拉第去慕尼黑见希特勒的教训依然适用：给独裁者想要的并不能阻止他要求更多；那只能让他相信你不够强大，以致不能阻挡他得到他想要的。否则，顺着独裁者的思路，你早在事情伊始之时就该站起来抵抗。“
国际象棋大师@Kasparov63 在2014年写了这本书《Winter is coming》，正是俄罗斯入侵乌克兰并强占克里米亚之后。</description>

      <title>Why read Arendt?</title>

      <description>汉娜阿伦特是德国出生的美国政治哲学家。受幸运女神的眷恋，在海德堡大学师从雅士培、海德格尔，国会纵火案后迅速离开纳粹德国，又从法国的隔离营逃脱，后来得到赴美签证离开欧洲。1941年5月22日，当她到达美国时，口袋里只有25美元，不会英语（德语是其母语），35岁，而她的重要作品还没有一部问世。
最近看到了Samantha Rose Hill的一条推文，才重新捡起了汉娜阿伦特的书，一发不可收拾，因为这次看进去了，也似乎看明白了。试着写下来，stop-think，停下来想想，看看自己是不是真得想清楚了。
阿伦特对孤独有独到的见解，隔离不是真正的孤独，不去与他人交流，不去行动才是真正的孤独。
她对如何思考也很特别。她说，思考就是一个人和自己的对话，而思考的主题是什么呢？个人的经验。正是因为有了对世界的体验，我们才会有困惑才会发现问题，才会试着解决问题。而理解这个世界，是阿伦特的最爱。如果说阿伦特是哲学家，那么她的哲学与以往的哲学家颇有不同，她不愿属于任何一个理论框架。相反，她的哲学是基于个人体验，是从下到上，是接地气的，而不是形而上的虚无缥缈。如果你也想理解这个世界，不妨试着读下阿伦特。
阿伦特自己是难民，从离开德国之后就无国籍了十多年，直到后来加入美国籍。所以她对无根的漂泊感受特别深。她还专门写过一篇文章，题目就是《我们这些难民》。作为一个移民，从漂泊时的思念到定居后难以融入再到四海为家，人之所在心之所安，这样的过程会让你更加爱读阿伦特。
阿伦特有本书叫《黑暗时代的人们》，她那时的背景当然是二战。而现在新冠疫情还没有结束、俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的仗也似乎没有到头，世界各国在印钱之后面临高通胀面临衰退的压力，前些时候美国高院泄漏出来或许会推翻反禁止堕胎的判例更是让人担心，这或许是我们自己的黑暗时代。也正因为如此，阿伦特的书更值得一读，也让人更有共鸣。
我爱读阿伦特，她试着理解她的世界，顺着她的思路，她其实是指引你思考的方法。思考不是要达致一个结论，思考是个永不停止的过程。在忙碌的生活中，我们或许需要时不时停下脚步，问问自己是否走在自己想走的路上，问问自己这世界究竟有什么改变，想想如何努力地去爱自己去爱家人，去爱这个并不完美的世界。去读读阿伦特吧。</description>

      <description>At a night with stars, you and I, may see a similar sky. At a day with sunshine, you and I, may see a different city. I am not sure what your city is. My city is so small and it has three grocery stores, two clinics, one children hospital, four schools, one library, two gas stations, a few parks and a river. Three remote cities still in my memory. Plus a few colleagues and friends.</description>

      <description>The leaked draft from the Court is a regression. Hope Amecian people will shoot it down.
Nobody has the right to use your body against your will, event to save your life, or the life of another person. That’s it. That’s the argument.
You cannot be forced to donate blood, or marrow, or organs, even though thousands die every year on waiting lists. They cannot even harvest your organs after your death without your explicit, written, pre-mortem permission.</description>

      <description>vorld Vorld is a personal world. V is just a half of W. In your time, the people you have met, the places you have been, the things you have done, these are your vorld. Just a small part of the world.
desire Lacan has a famous dictum, man’s desire is the desire of the Other. What you want, in the end, is a construct by the vorld from the world.</description>

      <description>Michael Peterson Is his writing difficult? I suppose so, in the sense that it uses a technical vocabulary specific to his work and the tradition he is working from. These are, most basically: phenomenology, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and Western philosophical history.
Combined, this leaves us in a position where the objects of his inquiry are varied and risk being construed as overly general. He writes about ethics, politics, language, time, space, forgiveness, the death penalty, sovereignty, Marxism, etc.</description>

      <title>乌克兰和上海</title>

      <description>峰峦如聚，波涛如怒，山河表里潼关路。望西都，意踟蹰。 伤心秦汉经行处，宫阙万间都做了土。兴，百姓苦；亡，百姓苦。
在我们这儿新冠疫情早在三月就结束了。到现在新冠已经有六波了，不过因为有mRNA疫苗的保护（大多数人都接种了三针）一切也算是正常。口罩还有人戴，公共交通还要求戴，其它场所就是自愿的了。现在的新闻主要就是乌克兰和上海。
俄罗斯入侵乌克兰已经50多天了，国内有不少人竟然说，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰是因为北约东扩，并以此为俄罗斯的侵略战争辩护。如果二战时希特勒入侵波兰是侵略，当年美国进攻伊拉克是侵略，为什么普京入侵乌克兰就不是侵略？站在俄罗斯那些邻国的角度，为什么那些国家要或者想要加入北约？不就是担心俄罗斯的威胁。而这次俄罗斯的入侵更证明了这些担心并非空穴来风。再说了，俄罗斯为什么不想那些邻国加入北约？不就是担心人民自己选择的自由会威胁或动摇独裁专制。对乌克兰的真正支持只有一种，那就是提供各种支援，包括食物、药品和武器弹药，支持乌克兰保家卫国，直到最后的胜利。
上海这个两千五百万人口的大都市因为奥密克戎而封城，由此引发各种惨剧。许多人没有受到新冠影响，却承受了封城的苦难。有人在家挨饿，有人急症得不到救治，有人不堪重负跳楼自尽。大白和红马甲却享受了至高权力的威风，以防疫之名可以随意殴打、抓捕，擅闯民宅。美领馆撤了，日本领馆没吃的了，韩国领事致函复旦请求让韩国留学生回国。一个国际大都市为什么会变成这样？武汉封城，西安封城，深圳封城，同样的悲剧为什么要一次次重复上演？难道润是普通百姓的唯一选择？</description>

      <description>I have been to several cities in my travel.
I lived in a city when I was young. In the north, there&amp;rsquo;s my childhood in a rural village and a high school. In the east, that&amp;rsquo;s my home for a while. In the west, I had my best college time. In the south, that&amp;rsquo;s where my girlfriend lived. At that time, the city was still small. I could walk to my grandma&amp;rsquo;s house on my little feet from my school.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It is unreal to watch some alleged leftists, in real time, fail to recognise a fascist dictatorship attempting to exterminate a liberal democracy, and calling for that democracy to surrender to fascism in the name of peace.&amp;rdquo; I am with Oz Katerji on this.
If we agree Hitler invaded Poland, we have to agree Putin invaded Ukraine. If we stand with Ukraine, we have to send all resources including food, medcine, and arms to help Ukraine to defend themselves, till the victorious end.</description>

      <description>Went hiking to a nearby park. Bit cold and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty soon that my face was numbed. Birds sang their morning songs with no stop. On the top, the white peaks of rocky mountians in the west are clear to see. But no one to see but birds.
Memory is clearly somewhere in our brain. When we remember something, it&amp;rsquo;s somehow printed hard there. If you practise, anything like jogging, swimming, basketball, guitar, violin, or piano, you know how the muscle memory is there.</description>

      <description>I still do not know what is the best way to say goodbye. I hate it. So all the time, I evaded them because they were sad. Upon graduation, I did not send my friends off. Leaving my hometown, I left alone. No one taught me, I just tried it out slowly as life moves on. I have so many things to say. But where to start?</description>

      <description>Double standard is everywhere in our life. The difference between I and others. The difference between my family and others. The difference between my people and others.
President Zelensky is leading a fight not only for defending Ukraine but the freedom of western values. He is a hero. But if we are serious, we have to deal with the double standard. Besides Kyiv, how about other cities like Baghdad, or Kabul?</description>

      <description>At the age of 93, Chomsky told us, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re approaching the most dangerous point in human history &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s monstrous for Ukraine.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It’s certainly right to have moral outrage about Putin’s actions in Ukraine,” he said of Biden’s recent declaration that the Russian president “cannot remain in power”. “But it would be even more progress to have moral outrage about other horrible atrocities… In Afghanistan, literally millions of people are facing imminent starvation.</description>

      <description>Freud already answered this question, of course, when he said that whereas Darwin decentered the human animal from the apex of creation, Copernicus decentered the earth from the center of the universe, Freud had decentered humanity in itself. No longer was the human immanent.
Lacan&amp;rsquo;s answer is perhaps even better: &amp;ldquo;That is why the unconscious was invented—so that we would realize that man&amp;rsquo;s desire is the Other&amp;rsquo;s desire, and that love, while it is a passion that involves ignorance of desire, nevertheless leaves desire its whole import&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Think of your mind like a pond full of fish and each fish is a feeling. Try to be the pond, not the fish.
Life is nothing but time given to us, short or long. For all of us, a day is long and a year is short. We use our days to trade for years. We trade our time for food, clothes, houses and cars. In the end, time is the only thing we do not have.</description>

      <description>After toit_start(), we have toit_esp32.cc to read. The first one is toit::start(). Toit here is just a namespace. As we know that toit supports OTA (over-the-air update) through WiFi and esp32 device is set to be a station (STA instead of AP).
What we have here is as follows:
 RtcMemory::set_up(); FlashRegistry::set_up(); OS::set_up(); esp_partition_find_first(); setup_program(support_ota); Scheduler::ExitState exit_state; VM vm; vm.load_platform_event_sources(); int groud_id = vm.scheduler()-&amp;gt;next_group_id(); exit_state = vm.scheduler()-&amp;gt;run_boot_program(program, null, group_id); OS::tear_down(); FlashRegistry::tear_down();  After these, esp32 may go to deep sleep.</description>

      <description>When I started to port the code to ESP32S3 following the example of ESP32C3, I realized I had to read the code closely. Here are the notes along the way.
Where does the code get started on esp32? Based on esp-idf, Toit (I like to pronounce it as tight) creates a new platform with a new programming language for developers.
For the code to start on the esp32 device, check all the files inside toolchains/esp32/.</description>

      <description>Today Putin ordered troops into pro-Russian region of eastern Ukraine in the name of peacekeeping. Ukraine invaded.
Then I saw the news of Dr. Paul Farmer. “The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that is wrong with the world.”</description>

      <description>I remember once offering to an editor an article which began with a reference to the experience of last century. “Oh,” he said, “leave out the history and come to the present.” I felt like going to him over a thousand miles and taking him by the lapels and saying, “Dear, dear jackass! Don’t you understand that the past is the present; that without what was, nothing is? That, of the infinite dead, the living are but unimportant bits?</description>

      <description>Do not ask your children
to strive for extraordinary lives.
Such striving may seem admirable,
but it is the way of foolishness.
Help them instead to find the wonder
and the marvel of an ordinary life.
Show them the joy of tasting
tomatoes, apples and pears.
Show them how to cry
when pets and people die.
Show them the infinite pleasure
in the touch of a hand.
And make the ordinary come alive for them</description>

      <description>“People without hope not only don’t write novels, but what is more to the point, they don’t read them. They don’t take long looks at anything, because they lack the courage. The way to despair is to refuse to have any kind of experience, and the novel, of course, is a way to have experience. The lady who only read books that improved her mind was taking a safe course - and a hopeless one.</description>

      <description>The good and the bad are everywhere all the time. While reading stories and watching movies there are always heroes and villains in these endless dramas. There are always Don Quixote and Sancho. What am I? What are you? A mixture of good and bad. That’s all. What if we stop dividing us into black and white?
  One teaching of Budha is now and here. What does it mean?</description>

      <description>Use an Airport to setup a WiFi network. Then download the binary of Jaguar. Run the following commands one after another. The second command requires the WiFi credentials. Use CTRL+C to stop the third one. To run the forth and the fifth command, put your computer on the same WiFi network as the esp32 device.
$./jag setup $./jag flash $./jag monitor $./jag scan $./jag run hello.toit </description>

      <description>Build some examples in toit and flash it to M5Core2.
There is no problem to follow the steps in one toit discussion. While trying the step4 for ft63xx. Found a typo in package.yaml. mpu6886 should be ft63xx.
Another issue is that the touch seems not working after unplugging the USB cable. Will investigate further. Will try jaguar tool later.</description>

      <description>Start to look at the toolchain for Rust on ESP32 family modules. After some googling, here is the first result.
Clearly the toolchain is working in its early stage. $ cargo build OK. Both espflash and espmonitor are working.

      <description>“Of special importance is the case in which substantial numbers of people, acting in concert, try to assure themselves of happiness and protection against suffering through a delusional reshaping of reality. The religions of mankind too must be described as example of mass delusion. Of course, no one who still shares a delusion will ever recognize it as such.”
“We never have so little protection against suffering as when we are in love; we are never so desolate when we have lost the object of our love or its love for us.</description>

      <description>Had my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer. Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. Why did the oil refineries around Carquinez Strait seem sinister to me in the summer of 1956?</description>

      <title>友谊是什么</title>

      <description>这是旧作重发。
如果你读了我那些关于人性之双重性的笔记，你或许会喜欢诗人David Whyte关于友谊的观点：
友谊的根本不在于改善，不是你变好，也不是她（他）变好。友谊的根本在于见证，一种被人关注的特权，同时也与人以关注特权，且行、且看、且信任，有时仅只陪伴，旅途或许短暂，却不可能一人独自行走。
The poet David Whyte said that &amp;ldquo;the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self. The ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone, and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them, and to have believed in them, and sometimes, just to have accompanied them, for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.</description>
