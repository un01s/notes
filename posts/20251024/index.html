There is nothing more or else to it, and there never has been, in any place or time.\nNoam Chomsky: In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to these policies. As is most of the population.\nPolitics is nothing but maintaining order. “There is no such thing as liberalism — or progressivism, etc. There is only conservatism. No other political philosophy actually exists; by the political analogue of Gresham’s Law, conservatism has driven every other idea out of circulation.” Or phrase it in another way: the constant struggle is new order versus old order or new money versus old money, and it is always order vs. anti-order just like conservatism vs. ant-conservatism.\nGresham’s Law: Bad money drives out good 劣币驱逐良币: In economics, Gresham’s law is a monetary principle stating that “bad money drives out good”. For example, if there are two coins in circulation containing metal of different value, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable coin based on the inherent value of its component metals will gradually disappear from circulation. “The king can do no wrong.” In practice, this immunity was always extended to the king’s friends, however fungible a group they might have been. Today, we still have the king’s friends even where there is no king (dictator, etc.). Another way to look at this is that the king is a faction, rather than an individual.\nSo this tells us what anti-conservatism must be: the proposition that the law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone, and cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.\nThe law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone; and it cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.\nGuess the freedom for one group is not freedom but privilege. The freedom for everyone is true freedom.\nWorld Affairs from the Sidewalks of Life By: Erik Rittenberry\nAll of us, thrown into the slaughterhouse of history, thrown into a world of assassinated Caesars and crucified Christs, into a woeful world of useless wars and mayhem, a world one madman away from nuclear annihilation, a world of technocratic schemers and censored truthtellers, a world where cancer eats the flesh, inflation eats the earnings, and progress eats the soul. I emerge from a dingy dive bar on E 4th Street and sit on a graffiti-covered bench in the sun to watch the frantic folks babble on phones and walk with an unholy detachment on the sidewalks of an evanescent empire. Everything is hectic and zooming by, fast fast fast, the great symphony of modernity — cheap amusements, diversions, billboards of smiling stooges, steel and cement and wifi, guns and knives and needles, conmen, thieves, and murderers, fat wallets placed in the back pockets of adderall-souled bigshots looking for the kill... but hey, I just sit here half-drunk in the golden afternoon and admire the girls because the world is ugly and they’re still pretty in their rustling skirts, and their lavender smiles make me smile as they stroll by my saluting eyes. O America, what have you done to your children, these callous cogs in a relentless wheel, these nervous news-watchers, these swollen toads of bitterness and anxiety that wage war on their own lives. This once beautiful land of Whitman and Emerson now reeks of mediocrity and madness. I say let us burn burn burn the hollow creeds and the bureaucratic yoke of this waiver signing society, and let us revive the Promethean fire of the dead poets who have more to offer us than any of these wretched talking heads with a vested interest in keeping you and I “adjusted” to the soulless algorithm of the status quo. Let us burn burn burn the headlines of treachery and the flimsy thrones of all these pallid-hearted politicians, and let us do away with the life-negating dogmas and all the stupidity corruption greed war murder and all the childish delusions that sustain the idiotic inanities of a belligerent world. Luckily, my friends, the ravens still flutter in the demented wind somewhere out there beyond the barbwire, and the grass still grows in the meadows, and the lilies still bloom on sunlit hillsides despite it all, yet here I am, sitting in the golden afternoon on the incomprehensible streets of mankind half-drunk with a 4-day beard ruminating on nothing valuable, nothing exceptional, nothing revolutionary, just sitting there, alone, in the feverish gloom of the afternoon dreaming about pine forests and jugs of wine and old trains slicing through prairies, quietly awaiting the next lavender smile to pass by. refs SF book: Too Like the Lightning by Ada Palmer, 2016\ncrooked timber\nhow to ask questions smartly?\nRamsay Leung\n","wordCount":"1000","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-10-24T04:22:52-06:00","dateModified":"2025-10-24T04:22:52-06:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"un01s"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20251024/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"un01s notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/ accesskey=h title="un01s notes (Alt + H)">un01s notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">anti-conservatism? & T to S to L? & One poem</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-10-24 04:22:52 -0600 -0600'>October 24, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>5 min</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>un01s</span></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#here-are-two-articles-on-testosterone aria-label="Here are two articles on testosterone:">Here are two articles on testosterone:</a></li><li><a href=#world-affairs-from-the-sidewalks-of-life aria-label="World Affairs from the Sidewalks of Life">World Affairs from the Sidewalks of Life</a></li><li><a href=#refs aria-label=refs>refs</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p><strong>T to S and S to L</strong> = sex is the drive of life, testosterone is the drive of sex</p><h2 id=here-are-two-articles-on-testosterone>Here are two articles on testosterone:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#here-are-two-articles-on-testosterone>#</a></h2><p><a href=https://archive.ph/XJbKb>Apr 30, 2025 web archive: Testosterone gave me my life back</a></p><p><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20251023020416/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/magazine/testosterone-women-health-sex-libido-menopause.html>Oct 22, 2025 web archive: Testosterone is giving women back their sex drive</a></p><p>HRT = hormone replacement therapy,
