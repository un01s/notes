The election’s high stakes inspired a stunning 2 million New Yorkers to cast ballots — the biggest turnout since 1969. “New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” Mamdani said in his victory speech. “Hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.”\nVoters in California also approved a new congressional map that could give the state a massive boost in 2026 midterm elections.\n20251029 Today Nvidia has just reached the market value of $5Trillion.

They have turned into (very well-off) vassals, who have to pay their dues to techno-feudal lords (Amazon; Google; Apple; Meta) – say, in order to selling and/or advertise on such platforms. The reason why this is the case is that rent-based capital has, just like under pre-industrial feudalism, supplanted profit-based capital as the driver of the economy. The fundamental system is no longer one where the capitalist extracts value from workers to generate as much profit as possible and be competitive in the market; re-invests in new machineries, technologies, etc., in order to make profit extraction ever more efficient; and thereby generates growth and innovation. It has rather become one where big tech bosses act like feudal lords – rentiers who own digital, rather than natural, “land” and can extract value (albeit in slightly different ways) from everyone who want or need to use their platforms. Like medieval lords, their power and wealth comes from sheer rent – for which, in a certain sense, they do not need to “do” anything.\nYet the idea that fighting it requires grappling with how to escape collectively from “carefully curated isolation” remains a crucial insight.
