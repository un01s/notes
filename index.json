[{"content":"At the age of 93, Chomsky told us, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re approaching the most dangerous point in human history \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s monstrous for Ukraine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It’s certainly right to have moral outrage about Putin’s actions in Ukraine,” he said of Biden’s recent declaration that the Russian president “cannot remain in power”. “But it would be even more progress to have moral outrage about other horrible atrocities… In Afghanistan, literally millions of people are facing imminent starvation. Why? There’s food in the markets. But people who have little money have to watch their children starve because they can’t go to the market to buy food. Why? Because the United States, with the backing of Britain, has kept Afghanistan’s funds in New York banks and will not release them.”\n“Because of Trump’s fanaticism, the worshipful base of the Republican Party barely regards climate change as a serious problem. That’s a death warrant to the species.”\n“Brexit was a very serious error, it means that Britain will be compelled to drift even further into subordination to the US,” he told me. “I think it’s a disaster. What does it mean for the Conservative Party? I imagine they can lie their way out of it, they’re doing a good job of lying about a lot of things and getting away with it.”\n“A lot of young people; Extinction Rebellion in England, young people dedicated to trying to put an end to the catastrophe. Civil disobedience – it’s not a joke, I’ve been involved with it for much of my life. I’m too old for it now [Chomsky was first arrested in 1967 for protesting against the Vietnam War and shared a cell with Norman Mailer]… It’s not pleasant to be thrown in jail and beaten, but they’re willing to undertake it.\n“There are plenty of young people who are appalled by the behaviour of the older generation, rightly, and are dedicated to trying to stop this madness before it consumes us all. Well, that’s the hope for the future.”\nCan we, like Putin, blame NATO for the invasion of Ukraine? No.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220406/","summary":"At the age of 93, Chomsky told us, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re approaching the most dangerous point in human history \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s monstrous for Ukraine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It’s certainly right to have moral outrage about Putin’s actions in Ukraine,” he said of Biden’s recent declaration that the Russian president “cannot remain in power”. “But it would be even more progress to have moral outrage about other horrible atrocities… In Afghanistan, literally millions of people are facing imminent starvation.","title":"Notes from Noam Chomsky Interview"},{"content":"$ pcat goes-to.c #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { int x = 5; // while x goes to 0:  while (x --\u0026gt; 0) { printf(\u0026#34;%d \u0026#34;, x); } printf(\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;); return 0; } $ gcc goes-to.c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./a.out 4 3 2 1 0 ","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220327/","summary":"$ pcat goes-to.c #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { int x = 5; // while x goes to 0:  while (x --\u0026gt; 0) { printf(\u0026#34;%d \u0026#34;, x); } printf(\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;); return 0; } $ gcc goes-to.c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./a.out 4 3 2 1 0 ","title":"Another C Code Joke"},{"content":"Freud already answered this question, of course, when he said that whereas Darwin decentered the human animal from the apex of creation, Copernicus decentered the earth from the center of the universe, Freud had decentered humanity in itself.
