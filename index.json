The gambler needs to learn new knowledge about the machines and simultaneously use what they have already learned to optimize their decisions. In the literature, these two activities are referred to as exploring and exploiting. You can’t do both things at the same time. When you explore, you are pulling new arms on the bandit trying to figure out their expected payout. When you exploit, you pull the best arm you’ve found. You need to find the right balance. If you spend too little time exploring, you get stuck playing a machine with a low expected payoff. But if you spend too much time exploring, you will earn less than you would if you played the best arm. This is the explore/exploit trade-off.\nexplore: open To navigate life we create mental models of the world out there, and then we confuse the models for reality. The trick is to collide your mental model with the outside world as often as possible. This is what exploring does.\nIf you can break inaccurate mental models, life becomes easier to navigate. But how do you do that? I know two ways.\nFind people who understand things better than you and read what they have to say. Read with the intention of answering your questions. If you can’t find the answers, email them.\nPerform experiments. By this I don’t mean do random things. I mean, STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS and FIND WAYS TO TEST IF THEY ARE FALSE. Most of the time, the slot machine of an experiment yields nothing. But that’s ok. A few will rearrange the world around you.\nBut, as I was saying before, there is a tradeoff. Time spent exploring to gather new information means less time acting on it. Besides, exploiting is often more valuable than it seems, since narrowing your focus to “slot machines” you know are promising can have nonlinear returns.\nexploit: focus John Ives on designing the iPhone: One of the things Steve [Jobs] would say [to me] because he was worried I wasn’t focused — he would say, “How many things have you said no to?” I would tell him I said no to this. And I said no to that. But he knew I wasn’t interested in doing those things. There was no sacrifice in saying no [to those things]. What focus means is saying no to something that with every bone in your body you think is a phenomenal idea, you wake up thinking about it, but you say no to it because you are focusing on something else.”\nWerner Herzog: Although for many years I lived hand to mouth—sometimes in semi-poverty—I have lived like a rich man ever since I started making films. Throughout my life I have been able to do what I truly love, which is more valuable than any cash you could throw at me. At a time when friends were establishing themselves by getting university degrees, going into business, building careers and buying houses, I was making films, investing everything back into my work.\nIn the terminology of multi-armed bandits, they found a good arm. Then they exploited it to the exclusion of everything else.\nWhy would focus compound? Part of it is time. If you care about less, you spend more time doing what you care about most. Also, you are always nonconsciously processing the thing you focus on. So cutting priorities means you work even when it looks like you’re not working.\ncomments 心外无别法。\nInterested in many things are just nature to us. To focus is not easy. To say no to things that attract you is difficult. Another hard constraint is the limit of time.\nHow to open your heart? Break it to open. Having a broken heart is the only way to have a life.\nLooking up at the stars, I know quite well That, for all they care, I can go to hell, But on earth indifference is the least We have to dread from man or beast. How should we like it were stars to burn With a passion for us we could not return? If equal affection cannot be, Let the more loving one be me. Admirer as I think I am Of stars that do not give a damn, I cannot, now I see them, say I missed one terribly all day. Were all stars to disappear or die, I should learn to look at an empty sky And feel its total dark sublime, Though this might take me a little time. —W.H.

There is an interesting article on money. Below are some notes.\nBartering is inconvenient because it requires “double coincidence of wants.” This makes it highly inefficient too.\nAs it evolved, money became increasingly symbolic. Money is abstract. It’s a belief system, a language, a social contract. Money is trust. But the rules aren’t written in stone.\nSilvio Gesell: money decays over time.\nthe properties of money — its durability and hoardability — impede its circulation: “When confidence exists, there is money in the market; when confidence is wanting, money withdraws.”\nThus, interest is a private gain at a public cost. In practice, those with money grow richer and those without grow poorer.\n“The merchant, the workman, the stockbroker have the same aim, namely to exploit the state of the market, that is, the public at large,” Gesell wrote. “Perhaps the sole difference between usury and commerce is that the professional usurer directs his exploitation more against specific persons.”\nGesell believed that the most-rewarded impulse in our present economy is to give as little as possible and to receive as much as possible, in every transaction. In doing so, he thought, we grow materially, morally and socially poorer. “The exploitation of our neighbor’s need, mutual plundering conducted with all the wiles of salesmanship, is the foundation of our economic life,” he lamented.\nTo correct these economic and social ills, Gesell recommended we change the nature of money so it better reflects the goods for which it is exchanged. “We must make money worse as a commodity if we wish to make it better as a medium of exchange,” he wrote.\nTo achieve this, he invented a form of expiring money called Freigeld, or Free Money. (Free because it would be freed from hoarding and interest.) The theory worked like this: A $100 bill of Freigeld would have 52 dated boxes on the back, where the holder must affix a 10-cent stamp every week for the bill to still be worth $100. If you kept the bill for an entire year, you would have to affix 52 stamps to the back of it — at a cost of $5.20 — for the bill to still be worth $100. Thus, the bill would depreciate 5.2% annually at the expense of its holder(s). (The value of and rate at which to apply the stamps could be fine-tuned if necessary.)\nIn his book “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,” John Maynard Keynes devoted five pages to Gesell, calling him a “strange and unduly neglected prophet.” He argued the idea behind a stamp scrip was sound. “I believe that the future will learn more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx,” Keynes wrote.\nBook: The natural economic order, 1915\nBook: Jacob Goldstein, Money: the true story of a made-up thing\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20231206/","summary":"First, an interesting book is coming, The dream you ordered is sold out what if money expired?

Firstly, we believed that as a result of Government policy, violence by the African people had become inevitable, and that unless responsible leadership was given to canalise and control the feelings of our people, there would be outbreaks of terrorism which would produce an intensity of bitterness and hostility between the various races of the country which is not produced even by war.\nSecondly, we felt that without sabotage there would be no way open to the African people to succeed in their struggle against the principle of white supremacy. All lawful modes of expressing opposition to this principle had been closed by legislation, and we were placed in a position in which we had either to accept a permanent state of inferiority, or to defy the Government. We chose to defy the Government. We first broke the law in a way which avoided any recourse to violence; when this form was legislated against, and when the Government resorted to a show of force to crush opposition to its policies, only then did we decide to answer violence with violence.\nBut the violence which we chose to adopt was not terrorism. We who formed Umkhonto were all members of the African National Congress, and had behind us the ANC tradition of non-violence and negotiation as a means of solving political disputes. We believed that South Africa belonged to all the people who lived in it, and not to one group, be it black or white. We did not want an inter-racial war, and tried to avoid it to the last minute. If the Court is in doubt about this, it will be seen that the whole history of our organisation bears out what I have said, and what I will subsequently say, when I describe the tactics which Umkhonto decided to adopt. I want, therefore, to say something about the African National Congress.\nThe African National Congress was formed in 1912 to defend the rights of the African people which had been seriously curtailed by the South Africa Act, and which were then being threatened by the Native Land Act. For thirty-seven years – that is until 1949 – it adhered strictly to a constitutional struggle. It put forward demands and resolutions; it sent delegations to the Government in the belief that African grievances could be settled through peaceful discussion and that Africans could advance gradually to full political rights. But white governments remained unmoved, and the rights of Africans became less instead of becoming greater. In the words of my leader, Chief Luthuli, who became President of the ANC, and who was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, I quote:\n\u0026ldquo;Who will deny that thirty years of my life have been spent knocking in vain, patiently, moderately, and modestly at a closed and barred door? What have been the fruits of moderation? The past thirty years have seen the greatest number of laws restricting our rights and progress, until today we have reached a stage where we have almost no rights at all\u0026rdquo;, unquote.\nTo continue,\n“We had no doubt that we had to continue the fight. Anything else would have been abject surrender. Our problem, My Lord, was not whether to fight, but was how to continue the fight. We of the ANC had always stood for a non-racial democracy, and we shrank from any action which might drive the races further apart than they already were. But the hard facts were that fifty years of non-violence had brought the African people nothing but more and more repressive legislation, and fewer and fewer rights.\nIt may not be easy for this Court to understand, but it is a fact that for a long time the people had been talking of violence – of the day when they would fight the white man and win back their country, and we, the leaders of the ANC, had nevertheless always prevailed upon them to avoid violence and to pursue peaceful methods. When some of us discussed this in June of 1961, it could not be denied that our policy to achieve a non-racial state by non-violence had achieved nothing, and that our followers were beginning to lose confidence in this policy and were developing disturbing ideas of terrorism.\nIt must not be forgotten, My Lord, that by this time violence had, in fact, become a feature of the South African political scene. There had been violence in 1957 when the women of Zeerust were ordered to carry passes; there was violence in 1958 with the enforcement of Bantu Authorities and cattle culling in Sekhukhuneland; there was violence in 1959 when the people of Cato Manor protested against pass raids; there was violence in 1960 when the Government attempted to impose Bantu Authorities in Pondoland. Thirty-nine Africans died in these Pondoland disturbances. In 1961 there had been riots in Warmbaths, and all this time, My Lord, the Transkei had been a seething mass of unrest. Each disturbance pointed clearly to the inevitable growth amongst Africans of the belief that violence was the only way out – it showed that a Government which uses force to maintain its rule teaches the oppressed to use force to oppose it. Already small groups had arisen in the urban areas and were spontaneously making plans for violent forms of political struggle. There now arose a danger that these groups would adopt terrorism against Africans, as well as whites, if not properly directed. Particularly disturbing was the type of violence engendered in places such as Zeerust, Sekhukhuneland, and Pondoland amongst Africans. It was increasingly taking the form, not of struggle against the Government – though this is what prompted it – but of civil strife between pro-government chiefs and those opposed to them conducted in such a way that it could not hope to achieve anything other than a loss of life, and bitterness.”\n[…]\n“At the beginning of June 1961, after a long and anxious assessment of the South African situation, I, and some colleagues, came to the conclusion that as violence [in this country – inaudible] was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the Government met our peaceful demands with force.\nThis conclusion, My Lord, was not easily arrived at. It was when all, only when all else had failed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us, that the decision was made to embark on violent forms of struggle, and to form Umkhonto we Sizwe. We did so not because we desired such a course, but solely because the Government had left us with no other choice. In the Manifesto of Umkhonto published on the 16th of December 61, which is Exhibit AD, we said\u0026rsquo;, I quote:\n\u0026ldquo;The time comes in the life of any nation when there remain only two choices – submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means in our power in defence of our people, our future, and our freedom\u0026rdquo;, unquote\nThis was our feeling in June of 1961, when we decided to press for a change in the policy of the National Liberation Movement. I can only say that I felt morally obliged to do what I did.”\nRachael:\nI also think what he is saying here is almost indisputably true, as much as some of us would like to deny it. You simply cannot expect people to repeatedly and stoically suffer state violence and the increasing degradation of their political conditions for decades on end without eventually becoming violent themselves, particularly if peaceful protest has become illegal. If people have no sanctioned or permitted avenues to petition states or governments to respect their rights, then asking them to refrain from disruption, illegal activity and violence is asking them to lie down and die. That goes against the core human instinct — yes, there is no way around it. It is literally inhuman to expect people to submit instead of fighting back when they are repeatedly violated.\nConcluding part of Mandela\u0026rsquo;s speech:\n“Above all, My Lord, we want equal political rights, because without them our disabilities will be permanent. I know this sounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. This makes the white man fear democracy.\nBut this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all. It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs as it certainly must, it will not change that policy.\nThis then is what the ANC is fighting. Our struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by our own suffering and our own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live.\nDuring my lifetime I have dedicated my life to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal for which I hope to live for and to see realised. But, My Lord, if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”\nWhy read Mandela now?

And once they’re in college, maybe you could say, “To get a good job,” but why would a potential hirer care how you did in multivariate calculus if your job doesn’t require any knowledge of calculus?\nI was one of these annoying students. I had the capacity to do well in school but never cared to because I never heard a good answer to this line of questioning. I never understood the point of truly learning the material in hard classes that you’re never going to use in the real world, and I assumed I could goof off and do the bare minimum and get away with it.\nBut I recently realized there is a very good reason to take Calculus. It’s to prove you can do hard things.\nThe ability to do hard things is perhaps the most useful ability you can foster in yourself or your children. And proof that you are someone who can do them is one of the most useful assets you can have on your life resume.\nOur self-image is composed of historical evidence of our abilities. The more hard things you push yourself to do, the more competent you will see yourself to be. If you can run marathons or throw double your body weight over your head, the sleep deprivation from a newborn is only a mild irritant. If you can excel at organic chemistry or econometrics, onboarding for a new finance job will be a breeze.\nBut if we avoid hard things, anything mildly challenging will seem insurmountable. We’ll cry into TikTok over an errant period at the end of a text message. We’ll see ourselves as incapable of learning new skills, taking on new careers, and escaping bad situations. The proof you can do hard things is one of the most powerful gifts you can give yourself.\nMy goal with our kids is to avoid lying to them as much as possible. I won’t tell them that calculus is super important or even that grades are super important. The truth is, they aren’t, so long as you have other plans. Calculus is a great way to prove you can do hard things if you have no other proof to show. But if you’re learning programming and building apps in your free time, or winning soccer championships, or writing a novel, then you are doing hard things. Probably harder than Calculus.\nThis is also why there’s so much survivorship bias and bad advice in the “C students hire A students” trope. Most C students are not doing other hard things instead of school. They’re just goofing off, so they end up working for the A student.\nBut some C students are getting C’s because they’re obsessed with other projects. Hard projects. And that obsession with doing hard things lets them blow past their Excellent Sheep peers over time. So if you have a C student who’s obsessed with something hard, you probably don’t have to worry. If they’re getting high and watching TikTok, well…\nI don’t particularly care what grades my kids get once they start school. But I do care that they consistently prove to themselves they can do hard things. If Calculus is how they want to do it, fine, but there are many, many more options.\nAnd if you’re not someone who knows they can do hard things, find a way to prove it to yourself. Build a habit, learn a skill, create something, whatever it is that turns your default stance on challenges from “that seems hard” to “I can figure it out.”\nCreate proof you can do hard things.\nHere is the original link.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20230817/","summary":"When a precocious yet nonconformist teenager asks why they need to learn calculus, what should you say?\nYou know they will never use it in adulthood, outside of certain career choices.\nYou could say, “It’ll help you get into college,” but then they’re left wondering why college cares if you know calculus.

Read the excerpt of this poem, the keeper of sheep, by Fernando Pessoa.\nI never kept sheep, But it is as I did watch over them. My soul is like a shepherd, Knows the wind and the sun, And goes hand in hand with the Seasons To follow and to listen. All peace of Nature without people Comes to sit by my side. But I remain sad like a sunset As our imagining shows it, When a chill falls at the side of the valley And you feel night has come in Like a butterfly through a window. But my sadness is calm Because it is natural and right And is what there should be in the soul When it is thinking it exists And the hands are picking flowers without noticing which. At a jangle of sheep-bells Beyond the bend of the road, My thoughts are contented. Only, I am sorry I know they are contented, Because, if I did not know it, Instead of being contented and sad, They would be cheerful and contented. To think is uncomfortable like walking in the rain When the wind is rising and it looks like raining more. I have no ambitions or wants. To be a poet is not ambition of mine. It is way of staying alone. There is ample metaphysics in not thinking at all. What do I think about the world? How should I know what I think about the world? If I were ill I would think about it. What idea have I about things? What opinion do I have on causes and effects? What meditations have I had upon God and the soul And upon the creation of the World? I don\u0026#39;t know. For me, to think about that is to shut my eyes. And not think. It is to draw the curtains Of my window (but it has no curtains). The mystery of things? How should I know I know what mystery is? The only mystery is there being somebody who might think about mystery. A man who stands in the sun and shuts his eyes Begins not to know what the sun is And to think many things full of heat. But he opens his eyes and sees the sun, And now he cannot think of anything, Because the light of the sun is worth more than the thoughts Of all the philosophers and all the poets. The light of the sun does not know what it is doing And so does stray and is common and good. Metaphysics? What metaphysics do those trees have? That of being green and having crowns and branches And that of giving fruit at their hours, - which is not what makes us think, Us, who don\u0026#39;t know to be aware of them. But what better metaphysics than theirs, Which is not knowing why they live And not knowing they don\u0026#39;t know? One wildly clear day, The kind when you wish you had done a pile of work Not to have to do any that day, I caught sight, like a road ahead among trees, Of what may be the Great Secret, That Great Mystery the false poets speak of. I saw that in no Nature, That Nature does not exist, That there are mountains, valleys, plains, That there are trees, flowers, grasses, That there are steams and stones, But that there\u0026#39;s not a whole to which this belongs, That any real and true connection Is a disease of our ideas. Nature is parts without a whole. This perhaps is that mystery they speak of. This was what without thought or even a pause I realised must be the truth Which all set out to find and do not find And I alone, because I did not try to find it, found. I take myself indoors and shut the window. They bring the lamp and give me goodnight, And my contented voice gives them goodnight. O that my life may always be this: The day full of sun, or soft with rain, Or stormy as if the world were coming to an end, The evening soft and the groups of people passing Watched with interest from the window, The last friendly look given the calm of the trees, And then, the window shut, the lamp lit, Not reading anything, nor thinking of anything, not sleeping, To feel life flowing over me like a stream over its bed, And out there a great silence like a god asleep.

It is one of the ways in which the artwork can avoid being consumed too easily. Poems need to thicken their textures and scramble their syntax if they are not to slip down too easily, which is the fate of the commodity. Everyday language is no longer a medium of truth. It has grown stale and threadbare, and only by wreaking violence on it can you force it to yield something of value. Literary modernism sends language on a spree, but that’s because it is so distrustful of it. Jameson has some comments here on Benjamin’s idea of an ur-language, an original speech in which things speak their own names. Then comes the Fall, in which the bond between word and thing is broken. Words become arbitrary signs of things, and language degenerates into a Babel of tongues.\nIf language is no longer to be trusted, you can turn instead to the image. Hence Benjamin’s passion for Surrealism, for which revelation lies in the clash between one image and another. You can take in an image at a glance, but not a narrative. Time is giving way to space, the sequential to the simultaneous. Modernism is among other things a crisis of narration, as the world ceases to be story-shaped. History is no longer informed by the plot once known as progress. Progress and continuity are fictions of the ruling class. They are also the delusions of those socialists who believed that capitalism was doomed to collapse, and that fascism was its death throes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everyday language unfolds in a linear way, and the general view is that history does too. We think of the past as finished and the present as open-ended, but this is not Benjamin’s opinion. In his ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’ it is the past that is incomplete, and the present that has a chance to bring it to fruition. What happens, happens, and does so irretrievably; but the meaning of such events is in the custodianship of the living, so that it is up to us to decide whether, say, a Neolithic child belonged to a species which ended up destroying itself. We can also ensure that those in the past who were defeated in their fight for justice and friendship did not die in vain – that in Benjamin’s phrase, the names of those anonymous men and women will be mentioned in dispatches on Judgment Day. The dead cannot literally be compensated for their suffering, but that suffering can be invested with new significance by our actions in the present. For the moment, then, the meaning of the past remains fluid, and our judgment on it must remain suspended.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Benjamin’s own dark political age is precisely such a moment of danger, one in which the continuity of history is violently ruptured; this opens up a space in which images of past struggles for emancipation can come flooding in. There is a trade-off between past and present: the present can rescue the past from oblivion, while the dead can be summoned to the aid of the living. Time can be looped on itself, as in Proust’s great narrative, to reveal a solidarity of the dispossessed across the centuries. It is the grandest narrative of all, though one that deflates the dream of inevitable progress for which most such tales are notorious. It is certain that the Messiah will come, but he will not arrive like the final note of a triumphal tune. On the contrary, he is the friend of all those who have been crushed and defeated in their day by such triumphalism, and his coming to power will be their victory too.\nMemory, for Benjamin as for Freud, can be an emancipating force, since those who wish to move forward must do so by turning back. In the hands of this most idiosyncratic of Marxists, even nostalgia can become a revolutionary concept. It is tradition that is subversive, not the act of abolishing it. What inspires men and women to revolt, Benjamin remarks, isn’t dreams of liberated grandchildren but memories of oppressed ancestors. His Angel of History turns his back on the future, and hence on all false utopias, gazing with horror at the mounting pile of rubble that is the past. It is not because history is valueless that the angel wants to end it; it is because much of its value springs from exploitation, and the latter weighs more heavily than the former. Hence Benjamin’s much quoted comment that every document of civilisation is also a record of barbarism.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The angel can’t move because his wings have become entangled in a storm, and Jameson seems uncertain about what this storm represents. Benjamin actually tells us: it is the myth of perpetual progress. What stops the angel from waking the dead here and now, calling time on history and ushering in redemption, is the assurance that history needs no such transformation, since it will carry us into a glorious future through its own momentum. It is the colossal complacency known as historical determinism that betrays the need for change.\nBaudelaire writes of the modern as fleeting and contingent on the one hand, and eternal and immovable on the other. Modernism is caught up in the random and provisional, but it is homesick for a time when (so the rumour goes) the absolute and infinite existed. There is an absence at the centre of the modernist work of art where you might just catch a glimpse of truth and reality, firm foundations and stable identities, everything the modern age has supposedly swept away. Postmodernism, by contrast, is too young and brash for such nostalgia. There is no haunting absence in the world. What you see is what you get. Truth and reality are convenient fictions, and identity is invented on the hoof. Modernism should abandon its metaphysical hankerings. As the postmodern philosopher Richard Rorty was fond of remarking: don’t scratch where it doesn’t itch.\u0026rdquo;\nSource: The Marxist and the messiah by Terry Eagleton\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20230205/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;In modernist art, obscurity can be a conscious strategy.

In the history of classes, revolution is the act of political creation, while legislation is the political expression of the life of a society that has already come into being. Work for reform does not contain its own force independent from revolution. During every historic period, work for reforms is carried on only in the direction given to it by the impetus of the last revolution and continues as long as the impulsion from the last revolution continues to make itself felt. Or, to put it more concretely, in each historic period work for reforms is carried on only in the framework of the social form created by the last revolution. Here is the kernel of the problem. It is contrary to history to represent work for reforms as a long-drawn out revolution and revolution as a condensed series of reforms. A social transformation and a legislative reform do not differ according to their duration but according to their content. The secret of historic change through the utilisation of political power resides precisely in the transformation of simple quantitative modification into a new quality, or to speak more concretely, in the passage of an historic period from one given form of society to another. Listen to this from Aldous Huxley. In 1958 he predicted a form of dictatorship that would rely not on force, but propaganda - and addiction.\nHere are some great notes on physics.

These things don’t contradict each other but exist on the same thematic and emotional plane. Love and pain, sometimes one and the same Alma and Reynolds will always be floating through time together, their love keeping them afloat yet also trapped in a repeating cycle, forever cursed. Here Paul is a director, Paul Thomas Anderson. He is also known by his initials PTA. Here is a list of his films: hard eight (1996), Boogie nights (1997), mognolia (1999), punch-drunk love (2002), there will be blood (2007), the master (2012), inherent vice (2014), phantom thread (2017) and licorice pizze (2021).\nAlma and Reynolds are two characters in the 2017 movie of Phantom Thread.\nPaul Anderson is an English actor of film and stage. He is best known for portraying Arthur Shelby in the BBC series Peaky Blinders.\nAnother thread. Shakespeare took great delight in confusing the audience about gender, and I’m gonna give you just two examples because I’m waiting for take-out. The famous best example is Twelfth Night, in which a male actor dresses up as Viola, a young woman who dresses up as a young man who falls in love with another man and who is loved by another woman (who is played by a man). But my personal favorite is Othello, when Desdemona’s maid explains women behave badly because they learned all that shit from men, and then you remember both women are being played by men, so the whole scene is really men holding up a mirror and saying “take a long ass look”. Shakespeare used the singular “they” centuries before it became the target of a cultural war, and it’s funny the OP should cite Macbeth because that’s where Shakespeare wrote “Unsex me here” ffs (take out is late).\n\u0026ldquo;when the facts come home to us, let us try at least to make them welcome.

I remember hearing an old Duchess say: \u0026lsquo;What do the poor want with holidays?

It was the moment at which Ireland became officially a western country, fixed in space at last as part of the developed and democratic world. This was all the more important because, unofficailly, it was not quiet either of those things. It was not economically developed in the sense that its new partners like France or Germany were. And its democracy, though institutionally very well established, was not as certain as it looked. It had within it two great subversive forces - its own traditions of violence and martyrdom; and the continuing confusion of citizenship with Catholicism.\nThus, Ireland\u0026rsquo;s entry into the EEC was not quite make-believe, more the other way around. It was an assertion of belief, an act of faith, that in turn would gradually make a reality. It said: this is who we are.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. **\nCarl Sagan in his book, The demon-haunted world, said something similar:\n~~ Every now and then, I’m lucky enough to teach a kindergarten or first-grade class. Many of these children are natural-born scientists — although heavy on the wonder side and light on scepticism.\nThey’re curious, intellectually vigorous. Provocative and insightful questions bubble out of them. They exhibit enormous enthusiasm. I’m asked follow-up questions. They’ve never heard of the notion of a ‘dumb question’.\nBut when I talk to high school seniors, I find something different. They memorize ‘facts’. By and large, though, the joy of discovery, the life behind those facts, has gone out of them.\nThey’ve lost much of the wonder, and gained very little scepticism. They’re worried about asking ‘dumb’ questions; they’re willing to accept inadequate answers; they don’t pose follow-up questions; the room is awash with sidelong glances to judge, second-by-second, the approval of their peers.~~\nThe Value of Science, by Richard Feynman From time to time people suggest to me that scientists ought to give more consideration to social problems – especially that they should be more responsible in considering the impact of science on society. It seems to be generally believed that if the scientists would only look at these very difficult social problems and not spend so much time fooling with less vital scientific ones, great success would come of it.\nIt seems to me that we do think about these problems from time to time, but we don’t put a full-time effort into them – the reasons being that we know we don’t have any magic formula for solving social problems, that social problems are very much harder than scientific ones, and that we usually don’t get anywhere when we do think about them.\nI believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy – and when he talks about a nonscientific matter, he sounds as naive as anyone untrained in the matter. Since the question of the value of science is not a scientific subject, this talk is dedicated to proving my point – by example.\nThe first way in which science is of value is familiar to everyone. It is that scientific knowledge enables us to do all kinds of things and to make all kinds of things. Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad – but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value – even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.\nI learned a way of expressing this common human problem on a trip to Honolulu. In a Buddhist temple there, the man in charge explained a little bit about the Buddhist religion for tourists, and then ended his talk by telling them he had something to say to them that they would never forget – and I have never forgotten it. It was a proverb of the Buddhist religion:\nTo every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.\nWhat then, is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use.\nBut the key obviously has value: how can we enter heaven without it?\nInstructions would be of no value without the key. So it is evident that, in spite of the fact that it could produce enormous horror in the world, science is of value because it can produce something.\nAnother value of science is the fun called intellectual enjoyment which some people get from reading and learning and thinking about it, and which others get from working in it. This is an important point, one which is not considered enough by those who tell us it is our social responsibility to reflect on the impact of science on society.\nIs this mere personal enjoyment of value to society as a whole? No! But it is also a responsibility to consider the aim of society itself. Is it to arrange matters so that people can enjoy things? If so, then the enjoyment of science is as important as anything else.\nBut I would like not to underestimate the value of the world view which is the result of scientific effort. We have been led to imagine all sorts of things infinitely more marvelous than the imaginings of poets and dreamers of the past. It shows that the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man. For instance, how much more remarkable it is for us all to be stuck – half of us upside down – by a mysterious attraction to a spinning ball that has been swinging in space for billions of years than to be carried on the back of an elephant supported on a tortoise swimming in a bottomless sea.\nI have thought about these things so many times alone that I hope you will excuse me if I remind you of this type of thought that I am sure many of you have had, which no one could ever have had in the past because people then didn’t have the information we have about the world today.\nFor instance, I stand at the seashore, alone, and start to think.\nThere are the rushing waves mountains of molecules each stupidly minding its own business trillions apart yet forming white surf in unison. Ages on ages before any eyes could see year after year thunderously pounding the shore as now. For whom, for what? On a dead planet with no life to entertain. Never at rest tortured by energy wasted prodigiously by the sun poured into space. A mite makes the sea roar. Deep in the sea all molecules repeat the patterns of one another till complex new ones are formed. They make others like themselves and a new dance starts. Growing in size and complexity living things masses of atoms DNA, protein dancing a pattern ever more intricate. Out of the cradle onto dry land here it is standing: atoms with consciousness; matter with curiosity. Stands at the sea, wonders at wondering: I a universe of atoms an atom in the universe.\nThe same thrill, the same awe and mystery, comes again and again when we look at any question deeply enough. With more knowledge comes a deeper, more wonderful mystery, luring one on to penetrate deeper still. Never concerned that the answer may prove disappointing, with pleasure and confidence we turn over each new stone to find unimagined strangeness leading on to more wonderful questions and mysteries – certainly a grand adventure!\nIt is true that few unscientific people have this particular type of religious experience. Our poets do not write about it; our artists do not try to portray this remarkable thing. I don’t know why. Is no one inspired by our present picture of the universe? This value of science remains unsung by singers: you are reduced to hearing not a song or poem, but an evening lecture about it. This is not yet a scientific age.\nPerhaps one of the reasons for this silence is that you have to know how to read the music. For instance, the scientific article may say, “The radioactive phosphorus content of the cerebrum of the rat decreases to one-half in a period of two weeks.” Now what does that mean?\nIt means that phosphorus that is in the brain of a rat – and also in mine, and yours – is not the same phosphorus as it was two weeks ago. It means the atoms that are in the brain are being replaced: the ones that were there before have gone away. So what is this mind of ours: what are these atoms with consciousness? Last week’s potatoes! They now can remember what was going on in my mind a year ago – a mind which has long ago been replaced.\nTo note that the thing I call my individuality is only a pattern or dance, that is what it means when one discovers how long it takes for the atoms of the brain to be replaced by other atoms. The atoms come into my brain, dance a dance, and then go out – there are always new atoms, but always doing the same dance, remembering what the dance was yesterday.\nWhen we read about this in the newspaper, it says “Scientists say this discovery may have importance in the search for a cure for cancer.” The paper is only interested in the use of the idea, not the idea itself. Hardly anyone can understand the importance of an idea, it is so remarkable. Except that, possibly, some children catch on. And when a child catches on to an idea like that, we have a scientist. It is late – although not too late – for them to get the spirit when they are in our universities, so we must attempt to explain these ideas to children.\nI would now like to turn to a third value that science has. It is a little less direct, but not much. The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty – some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain.\nNow, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question – to doubt – to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. Herein lies a responsibility to society.\nWe are all sad when we think of the wondrous potentialities human beings seem to have, as contrasted with their small accomplishments. Again and again people have thought that we could do much better. Those of the past saw in the nightmare of their times a dream for the future. We, of their future, see that their dreams, in certain ways surpassed, have in many ways remained dreams. The hopes for the future today are, in good share, those of yesterday.\nIt was once thought that the possibilities people had were not developed because most of the people were ignorant. With universal education, could all men be Voltaires? Bad can be taught at least as efficiently as good. Education is a strong force, but for either good or evil.\nCommunications between nations must promote understanding – so went another dream. But the machines of communication can be manipulated. What is communicated can be truth or lie. Communication is a strong force, but also for either good or evil.\nThe applied sciences should free men of material problems at least. Medicine controls diseases. And the record here seems all to the good. Yet there are some patiently working today to create great plagues and poisons for use in warfare tomorrow.\nNearly everyone dislikes war. Our dream today is peace. In peace, man can develop best the enormous possibilities he seems to have. But maybe future men will find that peace, too, can be good and bad. Perhaps peaceful men will drink out of boredom. Then perhaps drink will become the great problem whifh seems to keep man from getting all he thinks he should out of his abilities.\nClearly, peace is a great force – as are sobriety, material power, communication, education, honesty, and the ideals of many dreamers. We have more of these forces to control than did the ancients. And maybe we are doing a little better than most of them could do. But what we ought to be able to do seems gigantic compared with our confused accomplishments.\nWhy is this? Why can’t we conquer ourselves?\nBecause we find that even great forces and abilities do not seem to carry with them clear instructions on how to use them. As an example, the great accumulation of understanding as to how the physical world behaves only convinces one that this behavior seems to have a kind of meaninglessness. The sciences do not directly teach good and bad.\nThrough all ages of our past, people have tried to fathom the meaning of life. They have realized that if some direction or meaning could be given to our actions, great human forces would be unleashed. So, very many answers have been given to the question of the meaning of it all. But the answers have been of all different sorts, and the proponents of one answer have looked with horror at the actions of the believers in another – horror, because from a disagreeing point of view all the great potentialities of the race are channeled into a false and confining blind alley. In fact, it is from the history of the enormous monstrosities created by false belief that philosophers have realized the apparently infinite and wondrous capacities of human beings. The dream is to find the open channel.\nWhat, then, is the meaning of it all? What can we say to dispel the mystery of existence?\nIf we take everything into account – not only what the ancients knew, but all of what we know today that they didn’t know – then I think we must frankly admit that we do not know.\nBut, in admitting this, we have probably found the open channel.\nThis is not a new idea; this is the idea of the age of reason. This is the philosophy that guided the men who made the democracy that we live under. The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, and tossed out if necessary, with more new ideas brought in – a trial-and-error system. This method was a result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be a successful venture at the end of the eighteenth century. Even then it was clear to socially minded people that the openness of possibilities was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown. If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar.\nWe are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on. It is our responsibility to leave the people of the future a free hand. In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time. This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant as we are. If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming “This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!” we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination. It has been done so many times before.\nIt is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220830/","summary":"the value of science In 1955 Richard Feynman (1918-1988) had one essay, The Value of Science, published in Volume XIX of Engineering and Science.\nMy favorite quote from Feynman is as follows:\n** Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself.

Despite what advice columns and self-help books might teach, love, like criticism, is a peculiarly autocratic pursuit. One authorizes one’s own judgments and must live with the consequences. Sometimes—most of the time, some would say—we get it wrong. We err on the side of indulgence or cruelty, blind to (blinded by?) our own power. Yet to fail is not to fall into despair. Failing in love, and in criticism, lets us gain a sense of ethical relations: we perceive the conditionality of our judgments, and embrace our capacity to forgive and to be forgiven. Rose puts this better than I can hope to, in lines I often repeat to friends: “There is no democracy in any love relation: only mercy. To be at someone’s mercy is dialectical damage: they may be merciful and they may be merciless. Yet each party, woman, man, the child in each, and their child, is absolute power as well as absolute vulnerability. You may be less powerful than the whole world, but you are always more powerful than yourself.” —Merve Emre\nHere is another quote from Fernando Pessoa.\nWe never love anyone.

Feel something with the followings. One is that Steve Jobs on building a real company. The other is that Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman on competition.\nThe difficult thing to start a business is what to build, what is the feature of a product you really want but can\u0026rsquo;t find. But that\u0026rsquo;s not enough. How can you expand your product into a platform with that particular product. It may start with a niche product. In the end, it may be a platform with your products that everyone uses. If you have a right product, sooner or later you will move to the top. If your product is right, there is no competitons that could win from you. Your products will conquer your competitions. Just remember this: to win a war without fighting is the art. Put out your products there to break the will of others to fight.\nSo few real company builders. Steve Jobs on building a real company: I hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business. That’s how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will stand for something a generation or two from now. That’s what Walt Disney did, and Hewlett and Packard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That’s what I want Apple to be.\nSnowflake CEO Frank Slootman on competition: Patrick: Not all analogies are perfect. They\u0026rsquo;ll often fall down. I\u0026rsquo;m curious to hear where you think the analogy of business as war falls down. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of the Highlander analogy I\u0026rsquo;ve seen you put out there, which I absolutely love. I\u0026rsquo;d love you to tell people that one, because I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of compounding benefits to the market leader. So maybe mention that, what you mean by Highlander as a concept, and what the limits are to this concept of business as war, if any.\nFrank: Government can print money, and they do plenty of it. The rest of us, we have to take it from somebody else. And once you come to that realization, you also find out that they\u0026rsquo;re not going to take kindly to the fact that you\u0026rsquo;re taking this from them. So, and the bigger you get, now you become a looming threat and they\u0026rsquo;ll fight back with everything they have. It does feel like war, and not war in the sense that people are going to die, but companies are going to die. Companies are dying every day. Then they don\u0026rsquo;t reach viability. And then a lot of old ones that were successful, ones that are basically decaying on the vine, I mean, how many of those do we have out there?\nIt is a very visceral battle, but the way you know you\u0026rsquo;re winning, first of all, you need to define what winning is. I\u0026rsquo;ve always quoted US Grant and other people. They defined victory as breaking the enemy\u0026rsquo;s will to fight. It was not just kill them. It was breaking their will to fight. You can do that in a number of ways. But in a world of software, you break the enemy\u0026rsquo;s will to fight when you are hiring their people because they have given up. They\u0026rsquo;d rather be with you than they are with the other company, because it\u0026rsquo;s too hard and too painful and they\u0026rsquo;re not making money. So, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to join the winner instead of stick with delusion.\u0026rdquo; That happens in our world all the time. That is the Highlander analogy because every time the Highlander kills another Highlander, he takes on the strength of the other Highlander. The same thing is true in software. If I\u0026rsquo;m hiring a top salesperson, top engineer from another company, I\u0026rsquo;ve taken their strength now into my organization. It\u0026rsquo;s not just that I gained theirs, but they lose theirs. So it\u0026rsquo;s a double impact. I weakened them and I strengthened myself.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220623/","summary":"Just come across the tweets from Marcelino Pantoja.

The 18-year-old gunman was killed by police. Why tragedies like this happen again and again in the United States? Buffalo, Laguna Woods, Sandy hook, Santa Fe High, El Paso, and so many others.\nMarch 13, 1996. 26 years ago, a gunman entered Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, killed 16 kids and a teacher. The UK government responded by enacting tight gun control legislation. Since then there has been a total of zero school shootings in the UK.\n2 Ten days ago, it took the US Senate about twenty minutes to unanimously pass a bill extending security protection to the family members of Supreme Court justices when it looked like a house might be picketed. It is all a matter of whose families are worth protecting, and for what. They get extensive security, and you get thoughts, and prayers.\nRemember in 2008 that the Roberts Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision \u0026ndash; over a withering dissent by Stevens \u0026ndash; threw out democratically passed gun control laws. They invented a new 2nd Amendment and a false banner to rally around to stop basic protection of children. The lawmakers bear the greatest responsibility. But remember that the Court bears responsibility too. The gunman is never alone.\n3 Then some propose to have more police in the school. But there were three armed people in Uvalde scholl who did not stop the gunman with an AR15. The approach of \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s solve the gun problem with more guns!\u0026rdquo; has never worked. A black father comments that if the school has police, he has to worry about two threats to his kid instead of one.\nIn the school, they train the kids how to respond to the school shooting. How to find a shelter, how to buttress the door, and how to run for their lives. And good luck is in fact the only thing offered.\nThe moment to stop Uvalde was right after Sandy Hook. The US Senate and Congress could stop it right after the very first tragedy, but they chose not to stop it. Why? The obvious reason is their power over the lives of other people\u0026rsquo;s kids.\n4 The existing institutions are always there to protect the rich and the powerful instead of the poor and the weak.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220525/","summary":"1 Yesterday 21 people were killed in an attack by a lone gunman at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

The idea of the building, the intention of it, its design, are all immutable and are the essence of the building. The intention of the original builders is what survives. The wood of which the design is constructed decays and is replaced when necessary. To be overly concerned with the original materials which are merely sentimental souvenirs of the past, is to fail to see the living building itself.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother smiliar amusing tale is from Terry Pratchett in his book, The Fifth Elephant. \u0026ldquo;This, milord, is my family\u0026rsquo;s axe.

I suppose so, in the sense that it uses a technical vocabulary specific to his work and the tradition he is working from. These are, most basically: phenomenology, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and Western philosophical history.\nCombined, this leaves us in a position where the objects of his inquiry are varied and risk being construed as overly general. He writes about ethics, politics, language, time, space, forgiveness, the death penalty, sovereignty, Marxism, etc.\nBut there is a through-line that links his approaches to all of these subjects and you probably already know what the word here is: deconstruction. We will look at that in a second but first I want to balance that thought with a qualification\nNamely, Derrida is always writing about specific things. He isn’t writing about ‘language’ he is writing about Plato’s Phaedrus or Austin’s How to Do Things with Words. He isn’t writing about ‘time,’ but about a specific footnote in Heidegger.\nWhich is to say that whatever deconstruction turns out to mean, Derrida never ‘does deconstruction.’ Rather, as he says, he reads texts carefully and they deconstruct themselves. So what does that mean?\nDeconstruction is simple. It is a term used to refer to those cases when conditions for a phenomenon’s emergence are also conditions that render it impossible. D’s work demonstrates that this structure holds across a variety of phenomena.\nSo, e g, philosophical attempts to abolish the death penalty repeat the logic of sovereignty that establish the death penalty’s necessity. Hence Derrida’s claim that even in being abolished, the death penalty will survive.\nOr, to use a famous example, the logic that would privilege speech over writing due to its ostensible immediacy depends on the mediation that typifies writing, thus asserting the anachronistic primacy of writing over speech.\nThis latter is important because it establishes D’s so-called critique of the metaphysics of presence AND establishes the problem of writing as a general problem. In Signature Event Context he applies this argument to ‘experience in general’\nBy ‘impossible,’ then, we really just mean that a given concept, experience, phenomenon, whatever, never coincides with itself fully. It is never present to itself insofar as it depends on a binary that itself cannot be sustained rigorously.\n(In this sense, Derrida is also heir to French existentialism, particularly de Beauvoir’s Ethics of Ambiguity – an under-explored inheritance, in my estimation)\nAnd so Derrida’s work allows us to be rigorous in our critique of texts that seek to establish rigid boundaries and binaries through a thinking of exclusion OR assimilation. And to do so by way of that particular text’s own operation.\nDerrida is really just asking us to be attentive readers in all we do. And he has noticed that when we do so, texts (experiences) tend to become less stable and our inheritances from these allow for greater possibilities to come and which remain.\nQ\u0026amp;A Q: NO! That sounds like you\u0026rsquo;re saying deconstruction is just analysis, which is what bugs me so much about the popular use of the term \u0026lsquo;deconstruct\u0026rsquo;.\nA: I share this worry. I tried here to distinguish deconstruction from the practice Derrida is encouraging, which I here call attentive reading. Deconstruction is not an analysis, as you say, or a method. It is a self reflexive operation of concepts and texts.\nComments The scent of these moments when the impossible is possible, not in the sense that it would become possible, but in a more radical sense in which the impossible, as impossible, is possible. Winston Fettner\nDerrida saying, I never did like the term deconstruction, I love very much everything that I \u0026ldquo;deconstruct.\u0026rdquo;\nSource Further reading Brock Bahler Derrida coined deconstruction. He was inspired by Heidegger’s Destruktion of the history of philosophy. Heidegger was shaped by Luther’s destructio. Deconstruction is at the heart of the Protestant Reformation.\nDisclaimer #1: There are many iterations \u0026amp; variations of what ‘deconstruction’ has come to mean. It would be reductive to try to encapsulate all of them here. Indeed, the very meaning of the term suggests that texts \u0026amp; words have multiple meanings.\nDisclaimer #2: there are HUGE distinctive differences between Luther, Heidegger \u0026amp; Derrida. For one thing, Derrida, a Jew who experienced the effects of anti-Semitism and colonialism, would want nothing to do with Luther’s blatant anti-Judaism or Heidegger’s Nazism.\nScholars, traditions, religions often take ideas from one thinker they disagree w/ \u0026amp; use for a new purpose. But there is a certain spirit that is continuous in Luther \u0026gt; Heidegger \u0026gt; Derrida. Most notably, for ALL of them, deconstruction is a positive phenomenon\nLuther was inspired by Erasmus’s “to the sources!” Luther’s critique of the tradition was initiated by an appreciation for tradition. He thought the trad. had become so dependent on philosophical interpretations that they had stopped looking at what their texts actually said.\nFor Luther, then, “destructio” was BOTH a method of critiquing the tradition but also a passive event, namely, what God does to us. A key point here is that this ‘destructio’ is ultimately positive. Destruction results in edification; our own unmaking results in a new creation.\nHeidegger extracts ‘destructio’ from Luther’s theological context \u0026amp; applies it to his analysis of Western philosophyl tradition, accusing the trad. of getting so comfortable w/ a well-worn def. of Being it ultimately conceals how being is actually revealed in our everyday lives.\nLike Erasmus’ “to the sources” Heidegger [\u0026amp; Derrida] was inspired by Husserl’s “to the things themselves.” That clarion call ushered in the field of phenomenology. He thought a stronger foundation for philosophy could be attained by an appreciation for everyday experience.\nA “destruction” was in order. But not one that despises tradition, but one that invigorates it with new life, one that “should stake out the positive possibilities in that tradition” (BT 22). Destruktion sought to refreshingly open up the tradition to innovation and creativity.\nSo Derrida develops deconstruction. He offered many def. At times, he speaks of deconstruction as passive, as something that happens: texts turn in on themselves, are self-contradictory, \u0026amp; it is precisely from this undecidability that we gain meaning—interpretation is a risk\nMy favorite example is hospitality, a term Derrida discussed. \u0026ldquo;Hospitality\u0026rdquo; comes from the Latin hospes, which we get ‘hospitality.’ But it can also mean ‘foreign.’ Hospes is a combo of two Latin words: hostis \u0026amp; potis. Hostis is where we get the word ‘host’ but ALSO hostile.\nHostis originally meant stranger, but also went on to mean guest, or enemy, or army (as in the KJV \u0026lsquo;Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo;). Potis is were we get the word power. SO hospitality hinges on the paradox of having power to let someone in my house and giving up my power so they enjoy my things\nA radical, pure notion of hospitality (like a Platonic Form) would then be incomprehensible, as if I invited you to my house and then gave you the keys – like the Bishop in Les Miserables who gives Jean Valjean the candlesticks after he stole his silverware.\nAnd hospitality hinges on the dynamic, vulnerable risk of inviting the stranger who might actually be an enemy. That dynamic is most beautifully articulated in the words of Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker who recently survived a hostage situation.\nBut Derrida also spoke of deconstruction as a positive method for reading like Luther and Heidegger. as Catherine Keller summarizes: “To deconstruct is not to destroy but to expose our constructed presumptions.”\nSay you have a favorite book you’ve highlighted. Over time you become so used to the portions you highlighted that that becomes the text, a kind of myth of the full text. A deconstructive reading wonders: what have I missed from the parts that I didn’t highlight?\nBut Derrida saw deconstruction as an act of justice. Consistent w/ the Jewish trad of midrashic interpretation which seeks to discern meaning by reading between the lines, deconstruction asks: Who is missing from this text? What voices have been silenced from this trad?\nWhat are ways in which our reading of texts/traditions have become calcified that they\u0026rsquo;ve been reduced to an algorithm, to a mechanic one-size-fits all law, a hardened past? Deconstruction is an act of justice speaking through the cracks of the law, inviting us to an open future.\nAs John Caputo summarizes, deconstruction is an attempt to open texts and traditions with new life. It is not an attempt to destroy texts/traditions but to preserve them. The conservation of our traditions requires an inherent progressive openness to an unknown future.\nNow before you call this postmodern relativism, one more connection btwn Derrida \u0026amp; Luther: they were both inspired by Augustine. Augustine was shaped by a tradition that thought a good book SHOULD have many meanings not unlike the Jewish trad which says ‘the Torah has 70 faces.’\nIn Confessions bk 12 Auggie doesn’t think original authorial intent is primary. Thinking abt Genesis, he says not only is it impossible to know Moses’ mind, but he might have intended multiple meanings \u0026amp; might not even have been able to foresee all the meanings in his own text.\nEven if we could get the original intent, that’d be useless in itself as it just gives us a bare fact. The goal of reading is not Truth; the goal is the Good. He concludes that many interps. of the Bible should be permitted so long as they contribute to “the fullness of charity.”\nSo when @kkdumez @bethallisonbarr @socofthesacred or @jemartisby and so many other beautiful people asking important questions are slandered for “deconstruction,” I have to say, well none of them are citing Derrida (\u0026amp; none of them are really proposing anything all that radical!).\nBut the spirit of their work IS deconstructive: Projects that don’t want to destroy tradition but take it more seriously by reevaluating \u0026amp; innovating it w/ new life, through a concern for justice, for voices that have been silenced due to a calcified tradition.

We inherit a common sense of the society in one language or more. What you can do and what you cannot. Are those the filters and shapers of our desire? Perhaps. The point is that thoughts we may not show and things we may not do are just the surface of our desires, those chemicals running deep in our body.\nOn my way back, say hello to the birds and pat a dog for the first time.

They don’t take long looks at anything, because they lack the courage. The way to despair is to refuse to have any kind of experience, and the novel, of course, is a way to have experience. The lady who only read books that improved her mind was taking a safe course - and a hopeless one.

Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. Why did the oil refineries around Carquinez Strait seem sinister to me in the summer of 1956? Why have the night lights in the Bevatron burned in my mind for twenty years? What is going on in these pictures in my mind?\nLet Me Tell You What I mean, Joan Didion, 2021\nIt all comes back. Perhaps it is difficult to see the value in having one’s self back in that kind of mood, but I do see it; I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were. I have already lost touch with a couple of people I used to be; one of them, a seventeen­ year-old, presents little threat, although it would be of some interest to me to know again what it feels like to sit on a river levee drinking vodka-and­ orange-juice and listening to Les Paul and Mary Ford8 and their echoes sing “How High the Moon” on the car radio. (You see I still have the scenes, but I no longer perceive myself among those present, no longer could even improvise the dialogue.) The other one, a twenty-three-year-old, bothers me more. She was always a good deal of trouble, and I suspect she will reappear when I least want to see her, skirts too long, shy to the point of aggravation, always the injured party, full of recriminations and little hurts and stories I do not want to hear again, at once saddening me and angering me with her vulnerability and ignorance, an apparition all the more insistent for being so long banished.\nOn keeping a Notebook, Joan Didion\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20211224/","summary":"Had my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer.
