[{"content":"Went hiking to a nearby park. Bit cold and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty soon that my face was numbed. Birds sang their morning songs with no stop. On the top, the white peaks of rocky mountians in the west are clear to see. But no one while listening to those birds.\nMemory is clearly somwhere in our brain. When we remember something, it\u0026rsquo;s somehow printed hard there with no control of our will. If you practise, anything like jogging, swimming, basketball, guitar, violin, or piano, you know how the muscle memory is there. Not in your brain, but in your legs, arms, and fingers. In this sense, I believe the dualism of mind and body is a false statement. You just cannot distiguish between what is mind and what is body, because they are just indispensable parts of a life. Do not try to separate them.\nOur body has more than consciousness. It is like a chemical factory running without we know anything about it. Our feeelings, our reactions, our desires, and our reasonings are not under our will. But they are our will yet we have no control over it. I believe when we are aging and dying, we are losing the chemical drives little by little. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to know who we are.\nImagine a pack of wild wolf. They fight. They hunt. They live. They die. It is one wolf before the nature, together with other wolves within a pack. We are alone facing the nature. Then we have a comunity and grow a culture around. We watch. We explore. We read. We inherit a common sense of the society in one language or more. What you can do and what you cannot. Are those the filters and shapers of our desire? Perhaps. The point is that thoughts we may not show and things we may not do are just the surface of our desires, those chemicals running deep in our body.\nOn my way back, say hello to the birds and pat a dog for the first time. I can feel its eagerness to sniff me and its strength to play with me. Then wave goodbye to the lady. This is life.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220415/","summary":"Went hiking to a nearby park. Bit cold and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty soon that my face was numbed.

Why? There’s food in the markets. But people who have little money have to watch their children starve because they can’t go to the market to buy food. Why? Because the United States, with the backing of Britain, has kept Afghanistan’s funds in New York banks and will not release them.”\n“Because of Trump’s fanaticism, the worshipful base of the Republican Party barely regards climate change as a serious problem. That’s a death warrant to the species.”\n“Brexit was a very serious error, it means that Britain will be compelled to drift even further into subordination to the US,” he told me. “I think it’s a disaster. What does it mean for the Conservative Party? I imagine they can lie their way out of it, they’re doing a good job of lying about a lot of things and getting away with it.”\n“A lot of young people; Extinction Rebellion in England, young people dedicated to trying to put an end to the catastrophe.

Well, that’s the hope for the future.”\nCan we, like Putin, blame NATO for the invasion of Ukraine? No.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220406/","summary":"At the age of 93, Chomsky told us, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re approaching the most dangerous point in human history \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s monstrous for Ukraine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It’s certainly right to have moral outrage about Putin’s actions in Ukraine,” he said of Biden’s recent declaration that the Russian president “cannot remain in power”. “But it would be even more progress to have moral outrage about other horrible atrocities… In Afghanistan, literally millions of people are facing imminent starvation.","title":"Notes from Noam Chomsky Interview"},{"content":"$ pcat goes-to.c #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { int x = 5; // while x goes to 0:  while (x --\u0026gt; 0) { printf(\u0026#34;%d \u0026#34;, x); } printf(\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;); return 0; } $ gcc goes-to.c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./a.out 4 3 2 1 0 ","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220327/","summary":"$ pcat goes-to.c #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { int x = 5; // while x goes to 0:  while (x --\u0026gt; 0) { printf(\u0026#34;%d \u0026#34;, x); } printf(\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;); return 0; } $ gcc goes-to.c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./a.out 4 3 2 1 0 ","title":"Another C Code Joke"},{"content":"Freud already answered this question, of course, when he said that whereas Darwin decentered the human animal from the apex of creation, Copernicus decentered the earth from the center of the universe, Freud had decentered humanity in itself.
