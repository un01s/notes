It details some history of Bell Labs. Then there is a blog, why Bell Labs worked? shown up in the hackernews in early May. At last another blog on that blog. Below is a summary.\nWhy Bell Labs worked so well, and could innovate so much, while today’s innovation, in spite of the huge private funding, goes in hype-and-fizzle cycles that leave relatively little behind? A sad note is Bell Labs\u0026rsquo;s rate of innovation fizzled out after 1980s.\nBell Labs did have plenty of funding. But this is not the main reason. First of all, Bell and Kelly had an innate talent in spotting the “geekiest” among us. And they knew NOT to manage them. According to Kelly\u0026rsquo;s golden rule: \u0026ldquo;How do you manage genius? You don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; As Kelly eloquently put it: “What stops a gifted mind from just slacking off?” is the wrong question to ask. The right question is, “Why would you expect information theory from someone who needs a babysitter?”\nMBA culture (a metrics obsessed culture that is obsessed with narrowly defined productivity, MBA graduates and CEOs) destroyed the spirit of scientific and engineering ingenuity not because they are evil but because the financial incentives changed drastically from the times of Bell Labs. Nobody expected a single dime of profits to come out from the Bells Labs. The America that invested into the Bell Labs and into the Apollo project was very different from today’s America.\nPeter Higgs: By the time he retired in 1996, he was uncomfortable with the new academic culture. \u0026ldquo;After I retired it was quite a long time before I went back to my department. I thought I was well out of it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t my way of doing things any more. Today I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get an academic job. It\u0026rsquo;s as simple as that. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would be regarded as productive enough.\u0026rdquo;\nPeople who can survive this system aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the same as people who can do great work. Most of the great names of the past would be considered unemployable today.\nAnd, since nobody was expecting a dime back from Bell, nobody would put deadlines on talented people, nobody hired unqualified and arrogant business specialists to micromanage them, nobody would put them on a performance improvement plan if they were often late at their daily standups or didn’t commit enough lines of code in the previous quarter. So they had time to focus on how to solve some of the most complex problems that humans ever faced. So they could invent the transistor, the programming infrastructure still used to this day, and lay the foundations of what engineers study today. Tech has become all about monetization nowadays and nothing about ingenuity.\nA side note on neoliberalism Is the end of Bell Labs\u0026rsquo; glory because of the start of neoliberalism?\nChicago macro-economic theory rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macro-economics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations.\nNeoliberalism is a political and economic ideology that advocates for free-market capitalism, which became dominant in policy-making from the late 20th century onward. It originated among European liberal scholars during 1930s shaped bt Great Depression. It is designed to counter the volatility of free markets.\nIn the context of policymaking, neoliberalism is often used to describe a paradigm shift that was said to follow the failure of the post-war consensus and neo-Keynesian economics to address the stagflation of the 1970s, though the causal factors were purely external, which no economic modality has shown to be able to handle. The Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War also facilitated the rise of neoliberalism in the United States, the United Kingdom and around the world.\nAI is hot, but how long it will last? AI in the end is just a complicated computer program. No more no less. All the computers, and all electronics are feasible only after the control of electrons is possible. It is physics at working.\nLife, the real-world intelligence happens through the chemical reactions inside an self-organized system.\nWho are we? Just a name supported by the birth time and place. This is purely physics in time and space. But what are we? Can we explain all the chemical reactions happened and happening within our body along the time, from birth to death? No. Have we created an artificial life in a lab? No. Then, the way to created intelligence is still long.\nWe have gene-engineered medicine such as covid-19 vaccine. We have gene-therapy to counter some changes caused by virus. We created some animals or plants with partial gene-modification. Still there is no artificial life regardless of how simple created in the lab.\nAnother thing is about awake and dreaming: the activity of different awaring modes. The consciousness as we know is just a little like the iceberg above the water.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20250604/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFirst there was a book, The idea factory by Jon Gertner in 2012.

Everybody understood what a “thesis” is, whether or not they actually had one. But nobody understood “motive”. If I asked a student why they wrote the essay in front of them, they’d look at me funny. “Because I had to,” they’d say. Most writing is bad because it’s missing a motive. It feels dead because it hasn’t found its reason to live. You can’t accomplish a goal without having one in the first place—writing without a motive is like declaring war on no one in particular.\nThis is why it’s very difficult to teach people how to write, because first you have to teach them how to care. Or, really, you have to show them how to channel their caring, because they already care a lot, but they don’t know how to turn that into words, or they don’t see why they should. Instead, we rob students of their reason for writing by giving it to them. “Write 500 words about the causes of the Civil War, because I said so.” It’s like forcing someone to do a bunch of jumping jacks in the hopes that they’ll develop an intrinsic desire to do more jumping jacks. But that’s not what will happen. They’ll simply learn that jumping jacks are a punishment, and they’ll try to avoid them in the future.\nMost of the students who came into the Writing Center thought the problem with their essay was located somewhere between their forehead and the paper in front of them. That is, they assumed their thinking was fine, but they were stuck on this last, annoying, arbitrary step where they have to find the right words for the contents of their minds. But the problem was actually located between their ears. Their thoughts were not clear enough yet, and that’s why they refused to be shoehorned into words.\nWhich is to say: lots of people think they need to get better at writing, but nobody thinks they need to get better at thinking, and this is why they don’t get better at writing.\nLetters to a young poet, by Rainer Maria Rilke ","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20250504/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome excerpts from \u003ca href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/p/28-slightly-rude-notes-on-writing\"\u003e28 slightly rude notes on writing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003col start=\"16\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI worked in the Writing Center in college, and whenever a student came in with an essay, we were supposed to make sure it had two things: an argument (“thesis”) and a reason to make that argument (“motive”).

Allen\nThe world is full of people suffering from the effects of their own unlived life. They become bitter, critical, or rigid, not because the world is cruel to them, but because they have betrayed their own inner possibilities. The artist who never makes art becomes cynical about those who do. The lover who never risks loving mocks romance. The thinker who never commits to a philosophy sneers at belief itself. And yet, all of them suffer, because deep down they know: the life they mock is the life they were meant to live. \u0026ndash; Carl Jung\nWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, is not an act, but a habit. 我们是我们反复做的事情，卓越不是一种行为，而是一种习惯。亚里士多德（Aristotle）\nThe only real things in life is the unexpected things. Everything else is just an illusion. \u0026ndash; Watkin Tudor Jones\nJust remember that we have everything we need to change our life and the world around us. The world is an abstraction to our minds and it contains two parts, one real and the other imaginative. The real part (the reality) we experince through our senses (the sensed world is just a small part of the reality). The imaginative one we feel with our minds (this only exists in the mind). The world in our mind is both smaller and shorter than the universe (the reality). But it is much bigger that the world we are facing.\nThe rule is realized by \u0026ldquo;divide and conquer\u0026rdquo; because man is different anyway. To control is the instinct of power. Not to control individual, but to set up the platform, the media and the market to influence each individual. The technology is driven by the need, sooner or later, it evolves into the tools of the power. AI is the latest example. Why so much capital is poured into it? The control of the power in capitalism.\nThis writing is an attempt to clear my head. There are too many crises to reveal the deeper of the world if you pay attenttion to. Wars, financial crises, environmental crises. What are they telling you?\nhttps://www.campzhe.com/ Some examples to validate my idea about the world:\nCharles de gaulle began his war memoirs with this sentence: “All my life I have had a certain idea about France.” Well, all my life I have had a certain idea about America. I have thought of America as a deeply flawed nation that is nonetheless a force for tremendous good in the world. From Abraham Lincoln to Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and beyond, Americans fought for freedom and human dignity and against tyranny; we promoted democracy, funded the Marshall Plan, and saved millions of people across Africa from HIV and AIDS. When we caused harm—Vietnam, Iraq—it was because of our overconfidence and naivete, not evil intentions. \u0026ndash; David Brooks the origin of student debt from theintercept by Internet Archive in 1966, Berkeley, then nearly free to attend for California residents, had become a national center of organizing against the Vietnam War. Deep anxiety about this reached the highest levels of the U.S. government. John McCone, the head of the CIA, requested a meeting with J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, to discuss “communist influence” at Berkeley, a situation that “definitely required some corrective action.” Reagan pushed to cut state funding for California’s public colleges but did not reveal his ideological motivation. Rather, he said, the state simply needed to save money. To cover the funding shortfall, Reagan suggested that California public college could charge residents tuition for the first time. This, he complained, “resulted in the almost hysterical charge that this would deny educational opportunities to those of the most moderate means. This is obviously untrue. … We made it plain that tuition must be accompanied by adequate loans to be paid back after graduation.”\nIn retrospect, this period was the clear turning point in America’s policies toward higher education. For decades, there had been enthusiastic bipartisan agreement that states should fund high-quality public colleges so that their youth could receive higher education for free or nearly so. That has now vanished. In 1968, California residents paid a $300 yearly fee to attend Berkeley, the equivalent of about $2,000 now. Now tuition at Berkeley is $15,000, with total yearly student costs reaching almost $40,000.\nanother excerpt from Raymond Carver Some writers have a bunch of talent; I don\u0026rsquo;t know any writers who are without it.

Nodes in the CFG represent basic blocks (sequences of instructions that execute sequentially without branches), and edges represent the possible execution paths between those blocks.\nSSA form is a way to represent code where each variable is assigned a value only once within the program’s execution path. This means that each time a variable is assigned a new value, it’s given a new name. This makes it easier for compilers to perform certain optimizations, such as dead code elimination and common subexpression elimination.\nTo achieve SSA form, compilers often insert special instructions called phi-functions at the join points of the CFG where control flow merges from different paths. Phi-functions select the appropriate value of a variable based on which path was taken to reach that point.\nConsider the following example code snippet:\nif (condition) { x = 1; } else { x = 2; } y = x + 3; In SSA form, the code might look as follows:\nif (condition) { x1 = 1; } else { x2 = 2; } x3 = phi(x1, x2); // phi function to select the correct value of x y = x3 + 3; reference Harvard CS153: Lecture23 SSA form by Stephen Chong\nSSA form\nlab: SSA form\nCornell Global Analysis and SSA form\nIR by Cliff click\ncode async and await Tags vs function calls Nouns are timeless, while verbs describe processes which happen over time.

However, when the function calls happen between two computers, the execution has to depend on the other machine. For example, we might wait for the response from the other computer or process. An HTTP call is bit different from a function call.\nAsync: an asynch function is not guaranteed to execute in a single step.

I was once asked, at a journalism conference, how I defined my job. I said: My job is to write the exact same thing between 50 and 100 times a year in such a way that neither my editors nor my readers will ever think I am repeating myself.\nThat’s because good advice rarely changes, while markets change constantly. The temptation to pander is almost irresistible. And while people need good advice, what they want is advice that sounds good.\nThe advice that sounds the best in the short run is always the most dangerous in the long run. Everyone wants the secret, the key, the roadmap to the primrose path that leads to El Dorado: the magical low-risk, high-return investment that can double your money in no time. Everyone wants to chase the returns of whatever has been hottest and to shun whatever has gone cold. Most financial journalism, like most of Wall Street itself, is dedicated to a basic principle of marketing: When the ducks quack, feed ‘em.\nAs the founder of security analysis, Benjamin Graham, wrote in The Intelligent Investor in 1949: “The investor’s chief problem – and even his worst enemy – is likely to be himself.”\nFrom financial history and from my own experience, I long ago concluded that regression to the mean is the most powerful law in financial physics: Periods of above-average performance are inevitably followed by below-average returns, and bad times inevitably set the stage for surprisingly good performance.\nBut humans perceive reality in short bursts and streaks, making a long-term perspective almost impossible to sustain – and making most people prone to believing that every blip is the beginning of a durable opportunity.\nMy role, therefore, is to bet on regression to the mean even as most investors, and financial journalists, are betting against it. I try to talk readers out of chasing whatever is hot and, instead, to think about investing in what is not hot. Instead of pandering to investors’ own worst tendencies, I try to push back. My role is also to remind them constantly that knowing what not to do is much more important than what to do. Approximately 99% of the time, the single most important thing investors should do is absolutely nothing.\n“No individual can assist or save the age. He can only express that it is lost.” Without a moment’s hesitation, my dad retorted: “He’s right. But that’s exactly why you must try to assist and save the age.”\nI guess this is another way to say that \u0026ldquo;the pessimist is right but the optimist wins.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother piece of advice from C.S.Lewis: “Write about what really interests you, whether it is real things or imaginary things, and nothing else.\u0026quot; In the end, the fact of the matter is: if you want to be good, you really don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of choices. Cause it takes what it takes. Angus Deaton and his book, The Great Escape Angus Deaton was born in 1945. he is an economist and academic. he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2015. below are some quotes from his book, The Great Escape: health, wealth, and the origins of inequality.\nIf poverty is not a result of lack of resources or opportunities, but of poor institutions, poor government, and toxic politics, giving money to poor countries—particularly giving money to the governments of poor countries—is likely to perpetuate and prolong poverty, not eliminate it.\nTo worry about these consequences of extreme inequality has nothing to do with being envious of the rich and everything to with the fear that rapidly growing top incomes are a threat to the wellbeing of everyone else.\nWe should also be careful not to count the “leisure” of the unemployed as a benefit. Those who have lost their jobs are not choosing to spend more time at home, and study after study has documented that unemployed people are among the most dissatisfied with their lives.\nEconomists focus on income, public health scholars focus on mortality and morbidity, and demographers focus on births, deaths, and the size of populations. All of these factors contribute to wellbeing, but none of them is wellbeing.\nThis book is about the endless dance between progress and inequality, about how progress creates inequality, and how inequality can sometimes be helpful—showing others the way, or providing incentives for catching up—and sometimes unhelpful—when those who have escaped protect their positions by destroying the escape routes behind them.\nIndeed, as we shall see, it is a bad mistake to confuse life satisfaction and happiness; the former is an overall judgment about life that comes from consideration, while the latter is an emotion, a mood, or a feeling, which is part of experiencing life.\nIf democracy becomes plutocracy, those who are not rich are effectively disenfranchised. Justice Louis Brandeis famously argued that the United States could have either democracy or wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but not both. The political equality that is required by democracy is always under threat from economic inequality, and the more extreme the economic inequality, the greater the threat to democracy.\nLeisure time is not counted at all; if people decide to work less, and take more time for things they value more than work, national income and consumers’ expenditure will fall. One reason that French GDP per capita is lower than American GDP per capita is because the French take longer holidays, but it is hard to argue that they are worse off as a result. Nor do we count services that are not sold in the market, so that if a woman works at home to care for her family, it is not counted, but if she works in someone else’s home to care for their family, it is counted, and national income will be higher.\nIf everyone were free to migrate from one country to another, wages in rich countries would fall and wages in poor countries would rise, and the world would be a much more equal place. Of course, opposition to lower wages in rich countries is precisely why people are not permitted to migrate at will, and it is why meals and haircuts are so cheap in poor countries. The price of land, like the price of labor, cannot be arbitraged between rich countries and poor countries. Cheap housing in India or Africa cannot be brought up to American prices by simply moving the land across the ocean. The presence of cheap land and cheap labor in poor countries explains why price levels in poor countries are so much lower than in rich countries. The market sets the exchange rate to equalize the prices of steel, gasoline, automobiles, and computers—everything that can be and is part of international trade—but the price level depends on goods and services that cannot be traded. Because those are cheaper in poor places, the poorer the country, the lower are the average prices.\nThe evolution of income can be looked at from three different perspectives: growth, poverty, and inequality. Growth is about the average and how it changes, poverty about the bottom, and inequality about how widely incomes are spread across families or people.\nJohn Kay John Kay was born in 1948 in Edinburg, Scotland. He is a British economist. His books inclueds Other People\u0026rsquo;s Money: The Real Business of Finance (2015), The Truth about market (2005) and so on.\nIdeas shape the course of history.\nBut my lord, when we addressed this issue a few years ago, didn\u0026rsquo;t you argue the other side?\u0026quot; He said, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s true, but when I get more evidence I sometimes change my mind. What do you do?\nThe great muckraker Upton Sinclair had expressed a deep insight into the relationship between the world of ideas and the world of practical men: ‘It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.’\nInvestors look at economic fundamentals; traders look at each other; ‘quants’ look at the data. Dealing on the basis of historic price series was once described as technical analysis, or chartism (and there are chartists still). These savants identify visual patterns in charts of price data, often favouring them with arresting names such as ‘head and shoulders’ or ‘double bottoms’. This is pseudo-scientific bunk, the financial equivalent of astrology. But more sophisticated quantitative methods have since proved profitable for some since the 1970s’ creation of derivative markets and the related mathematics. For all that has recently been said about ‘the wisdom of crowds’, the authors prefer to fly with airlines which rely on the services of skilled and experienced pilots, rather than those who entrust the controls to the average opinion of the passengers.\nMost decisions are wrong. Most experiments fail. It is tempting to believe that if we entrusted the future of our companies, our industries, our countries, to the right people, they would lead us unerringly to the promised land. Such hopes are always disappointed. Most of Thomas Edison’s inventions did not work, Ford, Morris and Mao ended their careers as sad, even risible figures. Bill Gates missed the significance of the Internet, Mrs Thatcher introduced the poll tax, and Napoleon died in exile on St Helena. Even extraordinarily talented people make big mistakes.\nJohn Maynard Keynes The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct economist.\nCapitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone.\nThe master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts \u0026hellip;. He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular, in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man\u0026rsquo;s nature or his institutions must be entirely outside his regard. He must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood, as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near to earth as a politician.\nThe political problem of mankind is to combine three things: economic efficiency, social justice and individual liberty.\nMarkets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\nJohn Bogle (1929-2019): investment and speculation the index fund: Don\u0026rsquo;t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!\nEnough: True measures of money, business and life: As I have earlier noted, the most important things in life and in business can’t be measured. The trite bromide \u0026lsquo;If you can measure it, you can manage it\u0026rsquo; has been a hindrance in the building a great real-world organization, just as it has been a hindrance in evaluating the real-world economy. It is character, not numbers, that make the world go ‘round. How can we possibly measure the qualities of human existence that give our lives and careers meaning? How about grace, kindness, and integrity? What value do we put on passion, devotion, and trust? How much do cheerfulness, the lilt of a human voice, and a touch of pride add to our lives? Tell me, please, if you can, how to value friendship, cooperation, dedication, and spirit. Categorically, the firm that ignores the intangible qualities that the human beings who are our colleagues bring to their careers will never build a great workforce or a great organization.\nBuying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the stupidest things an investor can do.\nThe most important of these rules is the first one: the eternal law of reversion to the mean (RTM) in the financial markets. [the second time to write it down!]\nToday, in our society, in economics, and in finance, we place far too much trust in numbers. Numbers are not reality . At best, they are a pale reflection of reality. At worst, they’re a gross distortion of the truths we seek to measure. But the damage doesn’t stop there. Not only do we rely too heavily on historic economic and market data; our optimistic bias also leads us to misinterpret the data and give them credence that they rarely merit. By worshipping at the altar of numbers and by discounting the immeasurable, we have in effect created a numeric economy that can easily undermine the real one.\nwhy i don\u0026rsquo;t talk politics with friends Most people don\u0026rsquo;t have political views, they have political tribes\nDeveloping the political reasoning skills to graduate from tribes to views is incredibly difficult\nMost people don\u0026rsquo;t want to graduate from tribes to views\nbeing informed is tough To have an informed view on any given issue, one needs to:\nunderstand economics, game theory, philosophy, sales, business, military strategy, geopolitics, sociology, history, and more\nbe able to understand and empathize with the various (and often opposing) groups involved in a topic\ndetect and ignore their own bias (limited experience)\npeople don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave the tribe we are fantastic for finding community and identity.\nSo people are often faced with two options:\nA simple world with community, identity, and shared values\nA messy, complex world that takes more brainpower and alienates most of society\nPeople don\u0026rsquo;t want research and probabilities, they want a sports team[6] and simple religious code.\nThe Matrix portrayed it best \u0026ndash; when faced with the choice of calming delusion vs harsh reality, most people will choose the former.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20250323/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"this-is-a-good-piece-of-advice-for-investment-it-was-written-in-november-2014-by-jason-zweig\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://jasonzweig.com/saving-investors-from-themselves-2/\"\u003ethis is a good piece of advice for investment\u003c/a\u003e. it was written in November 2014 by \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Zweig\"\u003eJason Zweig\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was once asked, at a journalism conference, how I defined my job.

But Kahneman never contended that people are irrational. Instead he argued that they are inconsistent, emotional and easily fooled—most easily of all, by themselves. “Self-delusion helps sustain most people,” he told me years ago. In short, he made the case that people are neither rational nor irrational; they are, simply, human. Kahneman often said that decades of studying the human mind had taught him how to recognize—but not how to avoid—these pitfalls of decision-making.\nHere is the point: we are inconsistent human and we could recognize the bias but we could not avoid them.\nWe are making many decisions.

Here are two pieces of advice. One is from the Gmail creator Paul Buchheit.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the right approach to new products? Pick three key attributes or features, get those things very, very right, and then forget about everything else. Those three attributes define the fundamental essence and value of the product \u0026ndash; the rest is noise. For example, the original iPod was: 1) small enough to fit in your pocket, 2) had enough storage to hold many hours of music and 3) easy to sync with your Mac (most hardware companies can\u0026rsquo;t make software, so I bet the others got this wrong). That\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026ndash; no wireless, no ability to edit playlists on the device, no support for Ogg \u0026ndash; nothing but the essentials, well executed.\nBy focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essence and value of the product. If your product needs \u0026ldquo;everything\u0026rdquo; in order to be good, then it\u0026rsquo;s probably not very innovative (though it might be a nice upgrade to an existing product). Put another way, if your product is great, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be good.\nAnother is from Wil Chung\u0026rsquo;s Post: form follows function.\nUnderlying great creations that you love—be it music, art, or technology—its form (what it looks like) is driven by an underpinning internal logic (how it works). I noticed this pattern while watching a talk on cellular automaton and realized it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;form follows function\u0026rdquo; paraphrased from a slightly different angle. Inventing a form is a hard task, so you must approach it obliquely—by first illuminating the underlying function.\nWhen Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;form follows function,\u0026rdquo; what they meant was, form should follow function. And if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it, because there is no effort to spare for error.\nSo in the end, who creates the future?\n\u0026ldquo;The future is not shaped by people who don\u0026rsquo;t really believe in the future. Men and women of vitality have always been prepared to bet their futures, even their lives, on ventures of unknown outcome. If they had all looked before they leaped, we would still be crouched in caves sketching animal pictures on the wall.\u0026rdquo;\nV for Vendetta Alan Moore: We are told to remember the idea and not the man. Because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten. But 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I have witnessed firsthand the power of ideas. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people kill in the name of them. But you cannot kiss an idea\u0026hellip; cannot touch it or hold it.\nIdeas do not bleed. They do not feel pain. They do not love. And it is not an idea that I miss. It is a man.\nA man that made me remember the 5th of November. A man that I will never forget.\nPeople shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.\nBehind this mask there is more than just flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea\u0026hellip; and ideas are bulletproof.\nDavid Graeber, Debt: the first 5000 years Freuchen tells how one day, after coming home hungry from an unsuccessful walrus-hunting expedition, he found one of the successful hunters dropping off several hundred pounds of meat. He thanked him profusely. The man objected indignantly:\n\u0026ldquo;Up in our country we are human!\u0026rdquo; said the hunter. \u0026ldquo;And since we are human we help each other. We don\u0026rsquo;t like to hear anybody say thanks for that. What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.\n\u0026hellip; The refusal to calculate credits and debits can be found throughout the anthropological literature on egalitarian hunting societies. Rather than seeing himself as human because he could make economic calculations, the hunter insisted that being truly human meant refusing to make such calculations, refusing to measure or remember who had given what to whom, for the precise reason that doing so would inevitably create a world where we began \u0026ldquo;comparing power with power, measuring, calculating\u0026rdquo; and reducing each other to slaves or dogs through debt. It\u0026rsquo;s not that he, like untold millions of similar egalitarian spirits throughout history, was unaware that humans have a propensity to calculate. If he wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of it, he could not have said what he did. Of course we have a propensity to calculate. We have all sorts of propensities. In any real-life situation, we have propensities that drive us in several different contradictory directions simultaneously. No one is more real than any other. The real question is which we take as the foundation of our humanity, and therefore, make the basis of our civilization.\nDavid Graeber, Possibilities: Essays on Hierarchy, Rebellion, and Desire Traditional hedonism\u0026hellip;was based on the direct experience of pleasure: wine, women and song; sex, drugs and rock \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; roll; or whatever the local variant. The problem, from a capitalist perspective, is that there are inherent limits to all this. People become sated, bored\u0026hellip;Modern self-illusory hedonism solves this dilemma because here, what one is really consuming are fantasies and day-dreams about what having a certain product would be like.\nhedonism: a family of philosophical views that prioritize pleasure Dan Fischer: Living as if another world were possible Graeber viewed neoliberalism as primarily a political project masquerading as an economic one, and he exposed the system’s convoluted methods of keeping people demoralized, resentful, and hopeless about building a better world. These instruments of hopelessness included debt (Debt: The First 5,000 Years), corporate bureaucracy (The Utopia of Rules) and pointless work (Bullshit Jobs: A Theory). Graeber aptly described that last book as “an arrow aimed at the heart of our civilization.” It argued that most of our working hours are not producing anything useful, and that the workweek could easily be reduced to fifteen or even twelve hours if it weren’t for capitalists’ drive to keep us perpetually busy. “The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger,” he wrote, “Think of what started to happen when this even began to be approximated in the sixties.”\nDavid Graeber: what\u0026rsquo;s the point if we can\u0026rsquo;t have fun? We know at the present time that all animals, beginning with the ants, going on to the birds, and ending with the highest mammals, are fond of plays, wrestling, running after each other, trying to capture each other, teasing each other, and so on. And while many plays are, so to speak, a school for the proper behavior of the young in mature life, there are others which, apart from their utilitarian purposes, are, together with dancing and singing, mere manifestations of an excess of forces—“the joy of life,” and a desire to communicate in some way or another with other individuals of the same or of other species—in short, a manifestation of sociability proper, which is a distinctive feature of all the animal world.\nDavid Graeber: To live as a rebel—in the constant awareness of the possibilities of revolutionary transformation, and amongst those who dream of it—is surely the best way one can live.\nGo and read some from the anarchist library\nDavid Graeber on neo-liberalism\nRebecca Solnit and David Graeber\nRebecca Solnit: Flipping through Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology as I inadequately prepared myself for this event, I noticed that a decade ago it seemed like you had to be kind of defensive against the anti-utopian strain that was so strong then. Do you think that we’ve reclaimed utopia through Occupy and some of the other movements?\nDavid Graeber: I think it’s starting to happen. I think there has been a war of the imagination over the last several years. I was thinking a lot about what there might be to be optimistic about. And I came to the conclusion that this feeling of hopelessness that everybody had was a manufactured product, and that’s what neoliberalism is really about.

Gardner was the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Lyndon Johnson, an activist and author, and recipient of the 1964 Presidential Medal of Freedom. This speech was delivered to McKinsey \u0026amp; Company on November 10, 1990.\nSpeech Transcript\nI’m going to talk about “Self-Renewal.” One of your most fundamental tasks is the renewal of the organizations you serve, and that usually includes persuading the top officers to accomplish a certain amount of self-renewal. But to help you think about others is not my primary mission this morning. I want to help you think about yourselves.\nI take that mission very seriously, and I’ve written out what I have to say because I want every sentence to hit its target. I know a good deal about the kind of work you do and know how demanding it is. But I’m not going to talk about the special problems of your kind of career; I’m going to talk about some basic problems of the life cycle that will surely hit you if you’re not ready for them.\nI once wrote a book called “Self-Renewal” that deals with the decay and renewal of societies, organizations and individuals. I explored the question of why civilizations die and how they sometimes renew themselves, and the puzzle of why some men and women go to seed while others remain vital all of their lives. It’s the latter question that I shall deal with at this time. I know that you as an individual are not going to seed. But the person seated on your right may be in fairly serious danger. Not long ago, I read a splendid article on barnacles. I don’t want to give the wrong impression of the focus of my reading interests. Sometimes days go by without my reading about barnacles, much less remembering what I read. But this article had an unforgettable opening paragraph. “The barnacle” the author explained “is confronted with an existential decision about where it’s going to live. Once it decides.. . it spends the rest of its life with its head cemented to a rock..” End of quote. For a good many of us, it comes to that.\nWe’ve all seen men and women, even ones in fortunate circumstances with responsible positions who seem to run out of steam in mid-career. One must be compassionate in assessing the reasons. Perhaps life just presented them with tougher problems than they could solve. It happens. Perhaps something inflicted a major wound on their confidence or their self-esteem. Perhaps they were pulled down by the hidden resentments and grievances that grow in adult life, sometimes so luxuriantly that, like tangled vines, they immobilize the victim. You’ve known such people — feeling secretly defeated, maybe somewhat sour and cynical, or perhaps just vaguely dispirited. Or maybe they just ran so hard for so long that somewhere along the line they forgot what it was they were running for.\nI’m not talking about people who fail to get to the top in achievement. We can’t all get to the top, and that isn’t the point of life anyway. I’m talking about people who — no matter how busy they seem to be — have stopped learning or growing. Many of them are just going through the motions. I don’t deride that. Life is hard. Just to keep on keeping on is sometimes an act of courage. But I do worry about men and women functioning far below the level of their potential.\nWe have to face the fact that most men and women out there in the world of work are more stale than they know, more bored than they would care to admit. Boredom is the secret ailment of large-scale organizations. Someone said to me the other day “How can I be so bored when I’m so busy?” And I said “Let me count the ways.” Logan Pearsall Smith said that boredom can rise to the level of a mystical experience, and if that’s true I know some very busy middle level executives who are among the great mystics of all time.\nWe can’t write off the danger of complacency, growing rigidity, imprisonment by our own comfortable habits and opinions. Look around you. How many people whom you know well — people even younger than yourselves –are already trapped in fixed attitudes and habits. A famous French writer said “There are people whose clocks stop at a certain point in their lives.” I could without any trouble name a half of a dozen national figures resident in Washington, D.C., whom you would recognize, and could tell you roughly the year their clock stopped. I won’t do it because I still have to deal with them periodically.\nI’ve watched a lot of mid-career people, and Yogi Berra says you can observe a lot just by watching. I’ve concluded that most people enjoy learning and growing. And many are dearly troubled by the self-assessments of mid-career.\nSuch self-assessments are no great problem at your age. You’re young and moving up. The drama of your own rise is enough. But when you reach middle age, when your energies aren’t what they used to be, then you’ll begin to wonder what it all added up to; you’ll begin to look for the figure in the carpet of your life. I have some simple advice for you when you begin that process. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Look ahead. Someone said that “Life is the art of drawing without an eraser.” And above all don’t imagine that the story is over. Life has a lot of chapters.\nIf we are conscious of the danger of going to seed, we can resort to countervailing measures. At almost any age. You don’t need to run down like an unwound clock. And if your clock is unwound, you can wind it up again. You can stay alive in every sense of the word until you fail physically. I know some pretty successful people who feel that that just isn’t possible for them, that life has trapped them. But they don’t really know that. Life takes unexpected turns.\nI said in my book, “Self-Renewal,” that we build our own prisons and serve as our own jail-keepers. I no longer completely agree with that. I still think we’re our own jailkeepers, but I’ve concluded that our parents and the society at large have a hand in building our prisons. They create roles for us — and self images — that hold us captive for a long time. The individual intent on self-renewal will have to deal with ghosts of the past — the memory of earlier failures, the remnants of childhood dramas and rebellions, accumulated grievances and resentments that have long outlived their cause. Sometimes people cling to the ghosts with something almost approaching pleasure — but the hampering effect on growth is inescapable. As Jim Whitaker, who climbed Mount Everest, said “You never conquer the mountain, You only conquer yourself.”\nThe more I see of human lives, the more I believe the business of growing up is much longer drawn out than we pretend. If we achieve it in our 30’s, even our 40s, we’re doing well. To those of you who are parents of teenagers, I can only say “Sorry about that.”\nThere’s a myth that learning is for young people. But as the proverb says, “It’s what you learn after you know it all that counts.” The middle years are great, great learning years. Even the years past the middle years. I took on a new job after my 77th birthday — and I’m still learning.\nLearn all your life. Learn from your failures. Learn from your successes, When you hit a spell of trouble, ask “What is it trying to teach me?” The lessons aren’t always happy ones, but they keep coming. It isn’t a bad idea to pause occasionally for an inward look. By midlife, most of us are accomplished fugitives from ourselves.\nWe learn from our jobs, from our friends and families. We learn by accepting the commitments of life, by playing the roles that life hands us (not necessarily the roles we would have chosen). We learn by growing older, by suffering, by loving, by bearing with the things we can’t change, by taking risks.\nThe things you learn in maturity aren’t simple things such as acquiring information and skills. You learn not to engage in self-destructive behavior. You leant not to burn up energy in anxiety. You discover how to manage your tensions, if you have any, which you do. You learn that self-pity and resentment are among the most toxic of drugs. You find that the world loves talent, but pays off on character. You come to understand that most people are neither for you nor against you, they are thinking about themselves. You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing.\nThose are things that are hard to learn early in life, As a rule you have to have picked up some mileage and some dents in your fenders before you understand. As Norman Douglas said “There are some things you can’t learn from others. You have to pass through the fire.’\nYou come to terms with yourself. You finally grasp what S. N. Behrman meant when he said “At the end of every road you meet yourself.” You may not get rid of all of your hang-ups, but you learn to control them to the point that you can function productively and not hurt others.\nYou learn the arts of mutual dependence, meeting the needs of loved ones and letting yourself need them. You can even be unaffected — a quality that often takes years to acquire. You can achieve the simplicity that lies beyond sophistication. You come to understand your impact on others. It’s interesting that even in the first year of life you learn the impact that a variety of others have on you, but as late as middle age many people have a very imperfect understanding of the impact they themselves have on others. The hostile person keeps asking ‘Why are people so hard to get along with?” In some measure we create our own environment. You may not yet grasp the power of that truth to change your life.\nOf course failures are a part of the story too. Everyone fails, Joe Louis said “Everyone has to figure to get beat some time.” The question isn’t did you fail but did you pick yourself up and move ahead? And there is one other little question: ‘Did you collaborate in your own defeat?” A lot of people do. Learn not to.\nOne of the enemies of sound, lifelong motivation is a rather childish conception we have of the kind of concrete, describable goal toward which all of our efforts drive us. We want to believe that there is a point at which we can feel that we have arrived. We want a scoring system that tells us when we’ve piled up enough points to count ourselves successful.\nSo you scramble and sweat and climb to reach what you thought was the goal. When you get to the top you stand up and look around and chances are you feel a little empty. Maybe more than a little empty.\nYou wonder whether you climbed the wrong mountain.\nBut life isn’t a mountain that has a summit, Nor is it — as some suppose — a riddle that has an answer. Nor a game that has a final score.\nLife is an endless unfolding, and if we wish it to be, an endless process of self-discovery, an endless and unpredictable dialogue between our own potentialities and the life situations in which we find ourselves. By potentialities I mean not just intellectual gifts but the full range of one’s capacities for learning, sensing, wondering, understanding, loving and aspiring.\nPerhaps you imagine that by age 35 or 45 or even 33 you have explored those potentialities pretty fully. Don’t kid yourself!\nThe thing you have to understand is that the capacities you actually develop to the full come out as the result of an interplay between you and life’s challenges –and the challenges keep changing. Life pulls things out of you.\nThere’s something I know about you that you may or may not know about yourself. You have within you more resources of energy than have ever been tapped, more talent than has ever been exploited, more strength than has ever been tested, more to give than you have ever given.\nYou know about some of the gifts that you have left undeveloped. Would you believe that you have gifts and possibilities you don’t even know about? It’s true. We are just beginning to recognize how even those who have had every advantage and opportunity unconsciously put a ceiling on their own growth, underestimate their potentialities or hide from the risk that growth involves.\nNow I’ve discussed renewal at some length, but it isn’t possible to talk about renewal without touching on the subject of motivation. Someone defined horse sense as the good judgment horses have that prevents them from betting on people. But we have to bet on people — and I place my bets more often on high motivation than on any other quality except judgment. There is no perfection of techniques that will substitute for the lift of spirit and heightened performance that comes from strong motivation, The world is moved by highly motivated people, by enthusiasts, by men and women who want something very much or believe very much.\nI’m not talking about anything as narrow as ambition. After all, ambition eventually wears out and probably should. But you can keep your zest until the day you die. If I may offer you a simple maxim, “Be interesting,” Everyone wants to be interesting — but the vitalizing thing is to be interested. Keep a sense of curiosity. Discover new things. Care. Risk failure. Reach out.\nThe nature of one’s personal commitments is a powerful element in renewal, so let me say a word on that subject.\nI once lived in a house where I could look out a window as I worked at my desk and observe a small herd of cattle browsing in a neighboring field. And I was struck with a thought that must have occurred to the earliest herdsmen tens of thousands of years ago. You never get the impression that a cow is about to have a nervous breakdown. Or is puzzling about the meaning of life.\nHumans have never mastered that kind of complacency. We are worriers and puzzlers, and we want meaning in our lives. I’m not speaking idealistically; I’m stating a plainly observable fact about men and women. It’s a rare person who can go through life like a homeless alley cat, living from day to day, taking its pleasures where it can and dying unnoticed.\nThat isn’t to say that we haven’t all known a few alley cats. But it isn’t the norm. It just isn’t the way we’re built.\nAs Robert Louis Stevenson said, “Old or young, we’re on our last cruise.” We want it to mean something.\nFor many this life is a vale of tears; for no one is it free of pain. But we are so designed that we can cope with it if we can live in some context of meaning. Given that powerful help, we can draw on the deep springs of the human spirit, to see our suffering in the framework of all human suffering, to accept the gifts of life with thanks and endure life’s indignities with dignity.\nIn the stable periods of history, meaning was supplied in the context of a coherent communities and traditionally prescribed patterns of culture. Today you can’t count on any such heritage. You have to build meaning into your life, and you build it through your commitments — whether to your religion, to an ethical order as you conceive it, to your life’s work, to loved ones, to your fellow humans. Young people run around searching for identity, but it isn’t handed out free any more — not in this transient, rootless, pluralistic society. Your identity is what you’ve committed yourself to.\nIt may just mean doing a better job at whatever you’re doing. There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are –and that too is a kind of commitment. They have the gift of kindness or courage or loyalty or integrity. It matters very little whether they’re behind the wheel of a truck or running a country store or bringing up a family.\nI must pause to say a word about my statement “There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are.” I first wrote the sentence some years ago and it has been widely quoted. One day I was looking through a mail order gift catalogue and it included some small ornamental bronze plaques with brief sayings on them, and one of the sayings was the one I just read to you, with my name as author. Well I was so overcome by the idea of a sentence of mine being cast in bronze that I ordered it, but then couldn’t figure out what in the world to do with it. I finally sent it to a friend.\nWe tend to think of youth and the active middle years as the years of commitment. As you get a little older, you’re told you’ve earned the right to think about yourself. But that’s a deadly prescription! People of every age need commitments beyond the self, need the meaning that commitments provide. Self-preoccupation is a prison, as every self-absorbed person finally knows. Commitments to larger purposes can get you out of prison.\nAnother significant ingredient in motivation is one’s attitude toward the future. Optimism is unfashionable today, particularly among intellectuals. Everyone makes fun of it. Someone said “Pessimists got that way by financing optimists.” But I am not pessimistic and I advise you not to be. As the fellow said, “I’d be a pessimist but it would never work.”\nI can tell you that for renewal, a tough-minded optimism is best. The future is not shaped by people who don’t really believe in the future. Men and women of vitality have always been prepared to bet their futures, even their lives, on ventures of unknown outcome. If they had all looked before they leaped, we would still be crouched in caves sketching animal pictures on the wall,\nBut I did say tough-minded optimism. High hopes that are dashed by the first failure are precisely what we don’t need. We have to believe in ourselves, but we mustn’t suppose that the path will be easy, it’s tough. Life is painful, and rain falls on the just, and Mr. Churchill was not being a pessimist when he said “I have nothing to offer, but blood, toil, tears and sweat.” He had a great deal more to offer, but as a good leader he was saying it wasn’t going to be easy, and he was also saying something that all great leaders say constantly — that failure is simply a reason to strengthen resolve.\nWe cannot dream of a Utopia in which all arrangements are ideal and everyone is flawless. Life is tumultuous — an endless losing and regaining of balance, a continuous struggle, never an assured victory. Nothing is ever finally safe. Every important battle is fought and re-fought. We need to develop a resilient, indomitable morale that enables us to face those realities and still strive with every ounce of energy to prevail. You may wonder if such a struggle — endless and of uncertain outcome — isn’t more than humans can bear. But all of history suggests that the human spirit is well fitted to cope with just that kind of world.\nRemember I mentioned earlier the myth that learning is for young people. I want to give you some examples, In a piece I wrote for Reader’s Digest not long ago, I gave what seemed to me a particularly interesting true example of renewal. The man in question was 53 years old. Most of his adult life had been a losing struggle against debt and misfortune. In military service he received a battlefield injury that denied him the use of his left arm. And he was seized and held in captivity for five years. Later he held two government jobs, succeeding at neither. At 53 he was in prison — and not for the first time. There in prison, he decided to write a book, driven by Heaven knows what motive — boredom, the hope of gain, emotional release, creative impulse, who can say? And the book turned out to be one of the greatest ever written, a book that has enthralled the world for ever 350 years. The prisoner was Cervantes; the book: Don Quixote.\nAnother example was Pope John XXIII, a serious man who found a lot to laugh about. The son of peasant farmers, he once said “In Italy there are three roads to poverty — drinking, gambling and fanning. My family chose the slowest of the three.” When someone asked him how many people worked in the Vatican he said “Oh, about half.” He was 76 years old when he was elected Pope. Through a lifetime in the bureaucracy, the spark of spirit and imagination had remained undimmed, and when he reached the top he launched the most vigorous renewal that the Church has known in this century.\nStill another example is Winston Churchill. At age 25, as a correspondent in the Boer War he became a prisoner of war and his dramatic escape made him a national hero. Elected to Parliament at 26, he performed brilliantly, held high cabinet posts with distinction and at 37 became First Lord of the Admiralty. Then he was discredited, unjustly, I believe, by the Dardanelles expedition — the defeat at Gallipoli– and lost his admiralty post. There followed 24 years of ups and downs. All too often the verdict on him was “Brilliant but erratic…not steady, not dependable.” He had only himself to blame. A friend described him as a man who jaywalked through life. He was 66 before his moment of flowering came. Someone said “It’s all right to be a late bloomer if you don’t miss the flower show.” Churchill didn’t miss it. Well, I won’t give you any more examples. From those I’ve given I hope it’s clear to you that the door of opportunity doesn’t really close as long as you’re reasonably healthy. And I don’t just mean opportunity for high status, but opportunity to grow and enrich your life in every dimension. You just don’t know what’s ahead for you. And remember the words on the bronze plaque “Some men and women make the world better just by being the kind of people they are.” To be that kind of person would be worth all the years of living and learning.\nMany years ago I concluded a speech with a paragraph on the meaning in life. The speech was reprinted over the years, and 15 years later that final paragraph came back to me in a rather dramatic way, really a heartbreaking way.\nA man wrote to me from Colorado saying that his 20 year-old daughter had been killed in an auto accident some weeks before and that she was carrying in her billfold a paragraph from a speech of mine. He said he was grateful because the paragraph — and the fact that she kept it close to her — told him something he might not otherwise have known about her values and concerns. I can’t imagine where or how she came across the paragraph, but here it is:\n“Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.”\nPS: everyone need a personal philosophy. a few general rules to deal with the daily life. why? Science is solving the general problems for human being collectively. however, each person has to deal with specific localities and personal limitations and uncertainties around.\nPPS: \u0026ldquo;The old world is dying, the new world is slow to appear and in this chiaroscuro monsters emerge\u0026rdquo; (Antonio Gramsci)\n\u0026ldquo;Orban in Hungary completed his capture of power more than a decade ago.

In both models, the receiver is synchronous: when it’s ready to listen for messages it blocks until it gets a message (although variants allow for them to do a non-blocking poll or have a time out).\nCSP is fully synchronous. A channel writer must block until a channel reader reads. The advantage of that blocking based mechanism is that a channel only needs to ever hold one message. It’s also in many ways easier to reason about.\nWith actors sending is asynchronous. A message sender will not block whether the reader is ready to pull from the mailbox or not, instead the message goes into a queue usually called a “mailbox”. Which is convenient, but it’s a bit harder to reason about and mailboxes potentially have to hold a lot of messages.\nIn CSP processes communicate using channels. Program can create and pass them around as first class objects. Actors have an address system and inboxes. Only one address per process.\nIn CSP send and receive operation may block. In Actors Model only receive operation may block.\nIn CSP messages are delivered in order they were send, in Actors model it’s not the case. In fact system may not be able to deliver some messages at all. So far CSP model works best on one machine, while Actors model scales easily across several machines.\nIn a conclusion: Actors are more appropriate for distributed systems. Because of blocking nature of CSP, it’s hard to use them across several machines/runtimes.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20250220/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"ugly-code\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/2/20/ugly-code/\"\u003eugly code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect code doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee success if you haven\u0026rsquo;t solved a real problem for real people.

The job of fund managers is to ensure that giant pile of money grows. At the lowest end, it needs to grow in line with inflation, 9% annually in US for example.\nVC is spread-betting across a large number of startuos. They are trying to deploy a fund into a set of startups that matches their hopes, dreams and ambitions. Ultimately, there are just two goals. The lowest possible goal is to return the fund.\nA 3x or 4x return might be great for you, the founder, and perhaps for your early angel investors. For the VC industry, though, they’re looking for much higher potential than that. If everything goes perfectly to plan — your company gets everything right and sees a huge tailwind, where everything goes better than your wildest dreams — and you’re still not able to get the VCs to fund-returning-sized returns, you’re not in the right room. You’re selling something that doesn’t work within the VC model, which means you’re simply not a good investment.\nOne analogy here: music labels in the 70s, 80s, 90s.

Moral judgments are a part of the philosophy and law of a society, hence ideological and superstructural as well. The fundamental principle of bourgeois justice is that equals be given for equals in a free and open marketplace where men [it is always men] meet one another as legal equals, none compelled by law or custom to enter into bargains with another. The ideal capitalist, Marx argues, pays a fair price for the labor he employs. He pays a price equivalent to the reproduction cost of that labor, which, as he and Ricardo would say, is equal to the labor value embodied in that labor. Now, to be sure, capitalists do not play fair. As Marx tells us in the great chapter on The Working Day, capitalists try such underhanded tricks, in their effort to extract more value from their workers, as fiddling with the clocks in the factory so as to make the workers labor for a bit longer than the contracted for ten or twelve hours. But this is not exploitation. This is just cheating.\nA good deal of Volume One is devoted to discovering how capitalists manage to pull off this trick \u0026ndash; the secret to profit. Marx\u0026rsquo;s solution \u0026ndash; which, as I have explained at length elsewhere is in my opinion incorrect \u0026ndash; is the distinction between labor and labor power. It is as confused as asking whether, from a bourgeois perspective, feudal laws regulating the making and selling of craft goods are unjust. Exploitation would indeed be unjust in a socialist society, just as exploitation is just in a bourgeois society.\nDavid Ricardo (1772-1823), one of the most influential classical economists, along with Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith, and James Mills.\nessential readings on Marx\u0026rsquo;s thought The Economic-Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, The Communist Manifesto Volume One of CAPITAL Part One of THE GERMAN IDEOLOGY Marx: UNDERSTANDING by Robert Wolff MONEYBAGS MUST BE SO LUCKY by Robert Wolff Jerrold Siegel, MARX\u0026rsquo;S FATE Marx\u0026rsquo;s thought not Marxism background: French revolution, Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s wars and capitalism in England Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) \u0026amp; French Revolution (1789-1799) At that time, France was the wealthiest and most powerful nation in Europe. Continental Europe had not been much troubled by the overthrow and eventual restoration of the Stuarts in England a century earlier, but when the head of Europe\u0026rsquo;s most powerful monarch fell into a basket, people took notice. Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s brief conquests broke up the old Hapsburg Empire and set free cultural and political forces that transformed Central Europe. 1871, Paris Commune.\nNapoleon\u0026rsquo;s brief conquests broke up the old Hapsburg Empire and set free cultural and political forces that transformed Central Europe.\nThe development of capitalism in England: the explosive rise and expansion of capitalism. Unlike the political revolutions, this transformation matured first in England. Even France, whose highly developed and rationalized economy was still largely agricultural, did not experience the capitalist transformation as early as did England, and in the part of Europe in which Marx was growing up, the economy was still for the most part in a late feudal stage of development. The Communist Manifesto, 1848, published in London.\nFirst of all, there was an explosion of output. \u0026ldquo;new men\u0026rdquo;: factory owners who had begun life in modest circumstances as apprentices or journeymen, and made money so rapidly that in their own lifetimes they were able to marry their daughters off to impecunious aristocrats or buy themselves titles. the transformation of cities the erosion of the traditional authority and position of the landed aristocracy and the clergy the emergence of a large, literate class of businessmen, merchants, and their families, who became not only a market for the novel, as literary historians have noted, but also a powerful class demanding a real voice in the affairs of government, and prepared to call into question the traditional authority of king, noble, and cleric. part 2 Hegel immanentized and secularized the Christian story. The Christian story, in its outlines, recounts the succession of metaphysical or theological stages through which human beings move on their way from the beginning to the end of history. History begins with the Creation, which includes the creation of Man in the Garden of Eden. The second stage begins with The Fall, which results in mortality and the expulsion from Eden. The third stage commences with God\u0026rsquo;s compact with Abraham, repeated and deepened by the renewal of the compact [or Testament] with Noah and Moses. God gives to Man His Law, in the form of the Ten Commandments and their elaboration, and promises that if Man will keep this Law, God will make him to multiply and flourish. The entire period of the Old Testament is the period of The Law. But man repeatedly shows that he cannot keep God\u0026rsquo;s Law, which, since it is eternal and divine law, must obeyed to the last jot and tittle if at all. So God in His infinite mercy makes The Law flesh in the Person of His only begotten son, Jesus Christ. With the Incarnation there begins a new metaphysical stage in the history of Man, the stage of the Word Made Flesh. Jesus offers Man salvation if he will but have faith, which is to say believe in the truth of this Divine Promise. But this too is impossible for Man, so God confers upon some men, despite their not deserving or having earned it, the ability to have Faith, which is to say Grace. Jesus promises to return from beyond the grave, at which time the Final Judgment will determine who is saved and who damned. And Time itself will end.\nAll that is important is whether one lives before or after the Fall; whether one lives under the Law or after the Law has been made Flesh. Everything is to be understood theologically, not sociologically or anthropologically.\nWhat on earth does this have to do with capitalism and communism? Everything, as it turns out. The logical structure of the Christian story is this: A sequence of stages, each one utterly different from the others by virtue of its unique relation to God and His Law. The Creation, the Fall, the Old Testament, the Incarnation, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, the Last Judgment, and the End of Time are defined by that relationship. There is, notice, no other order in which these stages could possibly occur.\nMarx built Hegel\u0026rsquo;s notion of stages of social development into the theory of economic development that he called Historical Materialism. part 03 alienated labor: the object which labour produces \u0026ndash; labour\u0026rsquo;s product \u0026ndash; confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer part 04 crops \u0026lt;- time + labor: cultivation + rain + sunshine \u0026lt;- land\noil \u0026lt;- time + labor: survey, search + equipment \u0026lt;- land or sea\nproduct \u0026lt;- time + electricity: power + labor + raw material + machine \u0026lt;- factory\nthe difference bewteen feudalism and capitalism lies in the machines as a way to transform human labor into newly created products. farming uses a natural process (sunshine + rain + time) to add value to human labor. manuafacturing uses a man-made process (machine + power: steam, wind, electricity + time) to add value to human labor. then the ultimate factory is fully-automated with the raw material as the input and final refined new products as the output.\nthe machines with some technologies embedded empower their operator.\nThe alienation is multi-dimensional.\nFirst of all, the worker, as we have seen, is alienated from the product of her labor, which appears to her as an enemy controlling her and depriving her of freedom.\nThe worker is also alienated from fellow workers who are, or ought to be, colleagues and comrades in a collective undertaking. Since jobs are scarce and there is an endless pool of men and women desperately seeking jobs [the \u0026ldquo;reserve army of the unemployed,\u0026rdquo; as Marx famously called them], each worker sees the others as enemies, threatening to take one of the scarce jobs.\nThe capitalist, who is the real enemy, is misperceived as a benevolent figure graciously offering a subsistence job and allowing the worker to survive for another day.\nThe worker is alienated, as well, from the labor process, which becomes mechanical, painful, constricting, enslaving, rather than fulfilling, graceful, natural, human.\nAnd finally, the worker is alienated from herself, from her true nature or, in the language of the day, her \u0026ldquo;species being.\u0026rdquo; In what is surely one of the most moving passages in the entire socialist literature, Marx writes:\n\u0026ldquo;The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home. His labour is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague.\u0026rdquo;\n1848, the Communist Manifesto: the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\nin the Middle Ages, the real roots of clerical and monarchical power were mystified by religious superstition and the fiction of the divine right of kings, but that under capitalism, the clouds of mystery had been blown away by the cool breezes of reason, so that it was immediately apparent to nineteenth century Europeans that the power of church, state, and capital rested upon force alone. But the failure of the revolutions seems to have persuaded Marx that Capital\u0026rsquo;s power was itself mystified, by the doctrines of laisser-faire and free trade, so that it was not at all easy to understand how the ever-greater productivity of industrial capital served to strengthen its ability to defeat all challenges. By contrast, feudalism was relatively transparent. It was obvious even to the peasants themselves that the wealth of their feudal masters came from the days of labor service that they were forced to provide on the lord\u0026rsquo;s lands.\npart 5 classical political economy: Adam Smith and David Ricardo Turgot and Quesney: economic activities as an endless cyclical process of reproduction. the output of the nation at one point in time becomes the input of the productive process at a later point in time.\npart 6: who gets the surplus? kings, princes, oligarchs, pharaohs, priests, generals, landed aristocrats, tyrants \u0026ndash; and as entrepreneurs, merchants, advertising executives, lawyers, professors, and elected politicians. Life is good for the surplus getters; not so good for those who produce the surplus.\nHow do the surplus getters get the surplus?\nAt first, this is, and is understood to be, simple theft.

Moral judgments are a part of the philosophy and law of a society, hence ideological and superstructural as well.  The fundamental principle of bourgeois justice is that equals be given for equals in a free and open marketplace where men [it is always men] meet one another as legal equals, none compelled by law or custom to enter into bargains with another.  The ideal capitalist, Marx argues, pays a fair price for the labor he employs.  He pays a price equivalent to the reproduction cost of that labor, which, as he and Ricardo would say, is equal to the labor value embodied in that labor.  Now, to be sure, capitalists do not play fair.  As Marx tells us in the great chapter on The Working Day, capitalists try such underhanded tricks, in their effort to extract more value from their workers, as fiddling with the clocks in the factory so as to make the workers labor for a bit longer than the contracted for ten or twelve hours.  But this is not exploitation.

I think this can be cleared up if you just look at the very earliest descriptions of magic. Magic in its earliest form is often referred to as “the art”. I believe this is completely literal. I believe that magic is art and that art, whether it be writing, music, sculpture, or any other form is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words, or images, to achieve changes in consciousness. The very language about magic seems to be talking as much about writing or art as it is about supernatural events.\nI Opened A Book Julia Donaldson I opened a book and in I strode Now nobody can find me.

He expounds new ideas on the nature of space and time, and tries to provide solutions to the skepticism of Hume regarding knowledge of the relation of cause and effect and that of René Descartes regarding knowledge of the external world. This is argued through the transcendental idealism of objects (as appearance) and their form of appearance. Kant regards the former \u0026ldquo;as mere representations and not as things in themselves\u0026rdquo;, and the latter as \u0026ldquo;only sensible forms of our intuition, but not determinations given for themselves or conditions of objects as things in themselves\u0026rdquo;. This grants the possibility of a priori knowledge, since objects as appearance \u0026ldquo;must conform to our cognition\u0026hellip;which is to establish something about objects before they are given to us.\u0026rdquo; Knowledge independent of experience Kant calls \u0026ldquo;a priori\u0026rdquo; knowledge, while knowledge obtained through experience is termed \u0026ldquo;a posteriori\u0026rdquo;.[2] According to Kant, a proposition is a priori if it is necessary and universal. A proposition is necessary if it is not false in any case and so cannot be rejected; rejection is contradiction. A proposition is universal if it is true in all cases, and so does not admit of any exceptions. Knowledge gained a posteriori through the senses, Kant argues, never imparts absolute necessity and universality, because it is possible that we might encounter an exception.\nAlex Campbell\u0026rsquo;s youtube\nnotes background for The Critique of Pure Reason there was a great debate between Rationalists and Empiricists about a wide range of questions, including the nature of space and time, whether reason or sensibility is the source of human knowledge, and the scope, limits, even the possibility of such knowledge. On the rationalist side, there are Decartes, Leibniz, and Christian Wolff. On the empiricist side, there are British philosophers, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. So it is a debate between Continental Rationalists and British Empiricists.\nnotes on blog on July 21, 2011 20250202 The Inaugural Dissertation of 1770 was Kant\u0026rsquo;s attempt to resolve the dispute between Rationalism and Empiricism.\nTODO: part3\nreferences Norman Kemp Smith, Kant\u0026rsquo;s Critique of Pure Reason, English translation.

He expounds new ideas on the nature of space and time, and tries to provide solutions to the skepticism of Hume regarding knowledge of the relation of cause and effect and that of René Descartes regarding knowledge of the external world. This is argued through the transcendental idealism of objects (as appearance) and their form of appearance. Kant regards the former \u0026ldquo;as mere representations and not as things in themselves\u0026rdquo;, and the latter as \u0026ldquo;only sensible forms of our intuition, but not determinations given for themselves or conditions of objects as things in themselves\u0026rdquo;. This grants the possibility of a priori knowledge, since objects as appearance \u0026ldquo;must conform to our cognition\u0026hellip;which is to establish something about objects before they are given to us.\u0026rdquo; Knowledge independent of experience Kant calls \u0026ldquo;a priori\u0026rdquo; knowledge, while knowledge obtained through experience is termed \u0026ldquo;a posteriori\u0026rdquo;.[2] According to Kant, a proposition is a priori if it is necessary and universal. A proposition is necessary if it is not false in any case and so cannot be rejected; rejection is contradiction. A proposition is universal if it is true in all cases, and so does not admit of any exceptions. Knowledge gained a posteriori through the senses, Kant argues, never imparts absolute necessity and universality, because it is possible that we might encounter an exception.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Kant Critique of pure reason by Robert Paul wolff"},{"content":"As it has been said: Love and a cough cannot be concealed.

Jessica, it is so much easier to think of our lives, as we move under the brief luster of leaves, loving what we have, than to think of how it is such small beings as we travel in the dark with no visible way or end in sight. Yet there were times I remember under the same sky when the body\u0026#39;s bones became light and the wound of the skull opened to receive the cold rays of the cosmos, and were, for an instant, themselves the cosmos, there were times when I could believe we were the children of stars and our words were made of the same dust that flames in space, times when I could feel in the lightness of breath the weight of a whole day come to rest. But tonight it is different. Afraid of the dark in which we drift or vanish altogether, I imagine a light that would not let us stray too far apart, a secret moon or mirror, a sheet of paper, something you could carry in the dark when I am away.

One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time ― proof that humans can work magic.”\n“Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.” (The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark)\n卡尔.萨根《魔鬼出没的世界》：“最可悲的历史教训之一是：如果我们被欺骗的时间太长，我们往往会拒绝任何受骗的证据。我们不再有兴趣找出真相。欺骗已经俘获了我们。承认我们受骗了，甚至对我们自己来说，都太痛苦了。一旦你让骗子控制了你，你几乎永远无法走出来。”\n“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.

Hegel’s dialectic, in particular, is famous for its thesis-antithesis-synthesis progression.\nThesis: A proposition or an idea is put forward, starting the dialectical process. Antithesis: This initial idea is then countered with an opposing view or critique. Synthesis: Through the clash of thesis and antithesis, a new understanding (the synthesis) emerges, which in turn becomes a new thesis for further exploration. This triadic structure is not just a rigid formula; it’s a dynamic process that promotes the evolution of thought. It’s been applied in philosophy, sociology, literature, and even in everyday problem-solving.\nHegel was a prominent figure in the philosophical movement known as German Idealism—a philosophical perspective that asserts the primacy of ideas, consciousness, or the mind in shaping and understanding reality.\nIt holds that the ultimate nature of reality is rooted in ideas, concepts, or mental constructs rather than in material substances.\nIn other words, Idealism suggests that our understanding of the physical world is deeply influenced by our thoughts, perceptions, and interpretations, highlighting the role of the mind in shaping our experiences and knowledge.\nFor Hegel, reality is not just something \u0026ldquo;out there,\u0026rdquo; but it includes our thoughts and consciousness as well. He saw a close relationship between our minds and the external world, where they influence and shape each other.\nHegel believed that the physical world, including the objects and substances we can perceive with our senses, is not separate from our thoughts and consciousness. He saw a close connection between our minds and the external world, where they influence and shape each other.\nThis interaction happens as we continually learn and grow, gaining a better grasp of ourselves and the world around us.\nOne of Hegel\u0026rsquo;s most well-known contributions is his concept of dialectics, which is a method of reasoning and analysis that explores how opposing ideas and contradictions interact and transform into new understandings.\nHegel\u0026rsquo;s dialectical approach emphasises the dynamic nature of reality and the continuous development of thought through the resolution of conflicting ideas. In other words, Hegel believed that reality is always changing, and our understanding of it grows when we find solutions to conflicting ideas.\nAccording to Hegel, when people have different opinions or conflicting ideas (thesis and antithesis), they can engage in a process of dialogue and discussion to find a middle ground or a new perspective (synthesis) that incorporates the best elements of both sides.\nThis process allows for the growth of knowledge and a deeper understanding of complex issues.\nIt also acknowledges that conflicts and contradictions are not obstacles but rather catalysts for intellectual progress, fostering new insights and a more profound grasp of the truth.\nIn essence, the Hegelian dialectic is a method for resolving disagreements and advancing knowledge by engaging in thoughtful conversations, considering opposing perspectives, and seeking common ground.\nOne interesting article found on substack.\nindifferent and irrelevant will irrelevancy lead to indifference?\nOrdinary world, Duran Duran Papers in the roadside Tell of suffering and greed Fear today, forgot tomorrow Ooh, here besides the news Of holy war and holy need Ours is just a little sorrowed talk ","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20241004/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"dialectics\"\u003edialectics\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKant: Kant’s critical philosophy utilized dialectics to challenge metaphysical claims and to propose that reality is shaped by our perceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerman idealists: Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel further developed this idea, using dialectics to delve into the nature of being and knowledge itself.

Such thoughts are widely disseminated and, presumably, widely believed.\nstories have little to do with truth and everything to do with helping us impose order and certainty on a chaotic and unpredictable world, the storytelling theory purports to explain many things: why we believe in gods, myths and the supernatural; why we make art; why we put so little effort into distinguishing truth from lies; and why our decision-making is often so irrational.\nno one can truly know anything for certain\nhuman consciousness does not concern itself very much with truth. Lewis Wolpert wrote, \u0026ldquo;The primary aim of human judgment is not accuracy but the avoidance of paralyzing uncertainty. We have a fundamental need to tell ourselves stories that make sense of our lives.\u0026rdquo;\nScience is always at a disadvantage against religion because faith is unassailable while theory, by its very nature, is subject to constant revision. We see this play out constantly, as the faithful point to new scientific discoveries that upend previously held concepts in order to \u0026ldquo;prove\u0026rdquo; that science can\u0026rsquo;t be trusted. After all, religion is founded on an immutable story, a solid rock upon which we can lash ourselves in any storm, while science is merely the shifting sand under our feet. From a purely epistemological view, scientific theories can of course be proven while religious ones cannot; but from a psychological view, this is both irrelevant and delusional. People follow religions because their precepts can be neither proven nor disproven; the more impermeable to reason, the better.\nThe matter at hand is not about the value of science as a human endeavor, which has yielded benefits of incalculable value even for those who reject it (e.g., electricity, vaccines, global navigation, central heating, etc.). It is about telling stories that make us feel better about ourselves and the world around us, regardless of their objective validity.\nthe question here is whether, in the practice of just living our lives, a true story is any better for us than an untrue one. And if not, perhaps the story is not the basic building block of human thought that we currently think it is.\ncook vs write Alain de Botton: Cooks: make the food others too busy to prepare.

Populations evolve through changes in gene frequencies brought about through natural selection, drift, mutation and gene flow. Macro-evolutionary patterns are explained by micro-evolutionary processes of selection, drift, mutation and gene flow.\nFor ESS, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias and niche construction, share with natural selection some responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution and contribute to organism-environment complementarity. Inheritance extends beyond genes to encompass (transgenerational) epigenetic inheritance, physiological inheritance, ecological inheritance, social (hehavioural) transmission and cultural inheritance. Acquired characters can play evolutionary roles by biasing phenotypic variants subject to selection, modifying environments and contributing to heritability. Developmental bias, resulting from non-random mutation or phenotypic accommodation, means that some phenotypic variants are more likely than others. Developmental systems facilitate well-integrated, functional phenotypic responses to mutation or environmental induction. Variants of large effect are possible, allowing for rapid evolutionary change. Saltation can occur either through mutations in major regulatory control genes expressed in tissue-, module- or compartment-specific manners, or when developmental processes respond to environmental challenges with change in coordinated suites of traits, or through nonlinear threshold effects. Developmental systems can facilitate adaptive varaiation and modify selective environments. Evolution redefined as a transgenerational change in the distribution of heritable traits of a population. There is a broadened notion of evolutionary process and inheritance. Additional evolutionary processes, including developmental bias and ecological inheritance, help explain macro-evolutionary patterns and contribute to evolvability.\nESS wiki page ","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20240908/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eChanges in assumptions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003cth\u003emodern synthesis\u003c/th\u003e\n          \u003cth\u003eextended evolutionary synthesis\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003ethe pre-eminance of natural selection\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003ereciprocal causation (organisms shape, and shaped by, selective and developmental environments)\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003egenetic inheritance\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003einclusive inheritance\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003erandom genetic variation\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003enon-random phenotypic variation\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003egradualism\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003evariable rates of change\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003egene-centred perspective\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003eorganism-centred perspective\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003emicro-evolution\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003emacro-evolution\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor classical MS, the major directing or creative influence in evolution is natural selection, which alone explains why the properties of organisms match the properties of their environments (adaptation).

(1925-2012) We learn to live without passion. To be reasonable. We go hungry amid the giant granaries this world is. We store up plenty for when we are old and mild. It is our strength that deprives us. Like Keats listening to the doctor who said the best thing for tuberculosis was to eat only one slice of bread and a fragment of fish each day. Keats starved himself to death because he yearned so desperately to feast on Fanny Brawne. Emerson and his wife decided to make love sparingly in order to accumulate his passion. We are taught to be moderate. To live intelligently. “The heart lies to itself because it must.”\nstoicism Stoicism, then, is essentially unphilosophic. It simplifies human troubles by ignoring half of them. It is a wilful blindness, a constant begging of the question. It fosters apathy and paralyzes the sensibilities. It is through our sensibilities that we suffer, but it is through them, too, that we enjoy ; and when, by a practical annihilation of the body, the soul is rendered inaccessible to pain, it is likewise rendered both inaccessible and incompetent to real pleasure, \u0026ndash; to the pleasure of action ; for the source of half its impressions, the medium of its constant expression, the condition of human reciprocity, has been destroyed.\nBruce Chatwin “Man\u0026rsquo;s real home is not a house, but the Road, and that life itself is a journey to be walked on foot.” \u0026ndash; Bruce Chatwin, What Am I doing here?\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20240728/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-fallback\" data-lang=\"fallback\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003eThe danger of wisdom\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003eJack Gilbert (1925-2012)\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003eWe learn to live without passion.\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003eTo be reasonable.

You’ve stopped being here in the world.\u2028You’re in a different place,\u2028a place where human life has no meaning. You’re not a creature in body.\u2028You exist as the stars exist,\u2028participating in their stillness, their immensity. Then you’re in the world again.\u2028At night, on the cold hill,\u2028taking the telescope apart. You realize afterward\u2028not that the image is false\u2028but the relation is false. You see again how far away\u2028every thing is from every other thing. It is such a beautiful peom.\nQuote from Simone Veil, Waiting for God A beautiful woman looking at her imagein the mirror may very well believe the image is herself. An ugly woman knows it is not.\nLyrics, Billy Joel, Vienna You got your passion, you got your pride But don\u0026#39;t you know that only fools are satisfied? Dream on, but don\u0026#39;t imagine they\u0026#39;ll all come true (Oooh) When will you realize, Vienna waits for you? page 417. The Recognitions by William Gaddis -- They live in cities where nothing grows. Did you know that? Nothing grows in the city. Even their minds they keep steamheated. Their horizons are dirty windowsills. -- Drunk, perhaps. You never know. -- Whose chamberlain is a bishop and king, and his chief cook a king and an abbot, he couldn\u0026#39;t stoop to taking such titles as those. -- Do you know what happens to people in cities? I\u0026#39;ll tell you what happens to people in cities. They lose the seasons, that\u0026#39;s what happens. They lose the extremes, the winter and summer. They lose the means, the spring and the fall. They lose the beginning and end of the day, and nothing grows but their bank accounts. Life in the city is just all middle, nothing is born and nothing dies. Things appear, and things are killed, but nothing begins and nothing ends.

We say we want to become what we are or what we have an intent to be. We read the possibilities, or try. We get to some. We think we know how to read. We recognize a word, here and there, a syllable: male, it says perhaps, or female, talent - look what you could do - or love, it says, love is what we mean. Being at any cost: in the end, the cost is terrible but so is the lure to us. We see it move and shine and swallow it. We say we are and this is what we are as to say we should be and this is what to be and this is how. But, oh, it isn\u0026#39;t so. Metonymy As An Approach To A Real World Whether what we sense of this world is the what of this world only, or the what of which of several possible worlds - which what?- something of what we sense may be true, may be the world, what it is, what we sense. For the rest, a truce is possible, the tolerance of travelers, eating foreign foods, trying words that twist the tongue, to feel that time and place, not thinking that this is the real world. Conceded, that all the clocks tell local time; conceded, that \u0026#39;here\u0026#39; is anywhere we bound and fill a space; conceded, we make a world: is something caught there, contained there, something real, something which we can sense? Once in a city blocked and filled, I saw the light lie in the deep chasm of a street, palpable and blue, as though it had drifted in from say, the sea, a purity of space. The Holding Of lovers, one senses how, coupled, their joy is to think their singleness, together, to find themselves; how, holding each other, they think to hold as well as themselves, the truth, reality. We honor their wanting; what better could we want than that? Or, more than honor, we feel what they feel. If not for another sense, then this were all: we sense that what they hold is not the truth.

It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short.”\n― Arthur Schopenhauer, Essays and Aphorisms\nDays at the Morisaki Bookshop “It’s funny. No matter where you go, or how many books you read, you still know nothing, you haven’t seen anything. And that’s life. We live our lives trying to find our way. It’s like that Santōka Taneda poem, the one that goes, ‘On and on, in and in, and still the blue-green mountains.”\n“But, I don’t know, maybe it takes a long time to figure out what you’re truly searching for. Maybe you spend your whole life just to figure out a small part of it.” ― Satoshi Yagisawa, Days at the Morisaki Bookshop\nsimple with no deficiencie or complicated with no obvious deficiencies I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.\nThe first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late. ― C.A.R. Hoare\nthe rise of hyperpleasure Sex: If sex gives an 8, 9, 10 on the pleasure scale, then internet pornography gives a 20, 30, 100, etc. Sex demands vulnerability and requires two bodies, both of which will almost always be imperfect. Internet pornography, on the other hand, gives users the capacity to indulge any fantasy imaginable, almost always with perfect bodies. The user is almost always alone, which means he completely foregoes the social demands required during sex.\nPlay: If children sword fighting with sticks gives them an 8, 9, 10 on the pleasure scale, then video games give kids a 20, 30, 100, etc. Sword fighting with sticks requires an exertion of energy and use of the imagination. Video games are played on couches in an air-conditioned climate, where the work of imagination is done for them.\nReading: If reading gives an 8,9, 10 on the pleasure scale, then social media is a 20, 30, 100, etc. Reading requires a constant stream of focus, and not every sentence will hold our interest. Social media works around that discomfort by presenting bite-sized content, curated to be 100% interesting to us 100% of the time.\nConversation: If conversations give us an 8,9, 10 on the pleasure scale, then videos give us a 20, 30, 100, etc. Conversations demand something of us: We must pay attention to social cues, move things along with questions and statements, read the other person’s intonations and emotions.

The game is worthwhile insofar as we don’t know where it will end.\nSurprise is a gift of life.\nGiles Deleuze (1925-1995): Europe owes its Jews an infinite debt that Europe has not even begun to pay. Instead, an innocent people is being made to pay — the Palestinians.

I imagine a trench, about four feet wide and five feet deep, maybe sixty yards long, filled with runny, decaying shit. I imagine these people, some of them good friends, some of them barely acquaintances, at one end of this trench. I also imagine a faceless industry lackey at the other end, holding a fountain pen and a contract waiting to be signed.\nNobody can see what’s printed on the contract. It’s too far away, and besides, the shit stench is making everybody’s eyes water. The lackey shouts to everybody that the first one to swim the trench gets to sign the contract. Everybody dives in the trench and they struggle furiously to get to the other end. Two people arrive simultaneously and begin wrestling furiously, clawing each other and dunking each other under the shit. Eventually, one of them capitulates, and there’s only one contestant left. He reaches for the pen, but the Lackey says, “Actually, I think you need a little more development. Swim it again, please. Backstroke.”\nAnd he does, of course.

The gambler needs to learn new knowledge about the machines and simultaneously use what they have already learned to optimize their decisions. In the literature, these two activities are referred to as exploring and exploiting. You can’t do both things at the same time. When you explore, you are pulling new arms on the bandit trying to figure out their expected payout. When you exploit, you pull the best arm you’ve found. You need to find the right balance. If you spend too little time exploring, you get stuck playing a machine with a low expected payoff. But if you spend too much time exploring, you will earn less than you would if you played the best arm. This is the explore/exploit trade-off.\nexplore: open To navigate life we create mental models of the world out there, and then we confuse the models for reality. The trick is to collide your mental model with the outside world as often as possible. This is what exploring does.\nIf you can break inaccurate mental models, life becomes easier to navigate. But how do you do that? I know two ways.\nFind people who understand things better than you and read what they have to say. Read with the intention of answering your questions. If you can’t find the answers, email them.\nPerform experiments. By this I don’t mean do random things. I mean, STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS and FIND WAYS TO TEST IF THEY ARE FALSE. Most of the time, the slot machine of an experiment yields nothing. But that’s ok. A few will rearrange the world around you.\nBut, as I was saying before, there is a tradeoff. Time spent exploring to gather new information means less time acting on it. Besides, exploiting is often more valuable than it seems, since narrowing your focus to “slot machines” you know are promising can have nonlinear returns.\nexploit: focus John Ives on designing the iPhone: One of the things Steve [Jobs] would say [to me] because he was worried I wasn’t focused — he would say, “How many things have you said no to?” I would tell him I said no to this. And I said no to that. But he knew I wasn’t interested in doing those things. There was no sacrifice in saying no [to those things]. What focus means is saying no to something that with every bone in your body you think is a phenomenal idea, you wake up thinking about it, but you say no to it because you are focusing on something else.”\nWerner Herzog: Although for many years I lived hand to mouth—sometimes in semi-poverty—I have lived like a rich man ever since I started making films. Throughout my life I have been able to do what I truly love, which is more valuable than any cash you could throw at me. At a time when friends were establishing themselves by getting university degrees, going into business, building careers and buying houses, I was making films, investing everything back into my work.\nIn the terminology of multi-armed bandits, they found a good arm. Then they exploited it to the exclusion of everything else.\nWhy would focus compound? Part of it is time. If you care about less, you spend more time doing what you care about most. Also, you are always nonconsciously processing the thing you focus on. So cutting priorities means you work even when it looks like you’re not working.\ncomments 心外无别法。\nInterested in many things are just nature to us. To focus is not easy. To say no to things that attract you is difficult. Another hard constraint is the limit of time.\nHow to open your heart? Break it to open. Having a broken heart is the only way to have a life.\nLooking up at the stars, I know quite well That, for all they care, I can go to hell, But on earth indifference is the least We have to dread from man or beast. How should we like it were stars to burn With a passion for us we could not return? If equal affection cannot be, Let the more loving one be me. Admirer as I think I am Of stars that do not give a damn, I cannot, now I see them, say I missed one terribly all day. Were all stars to disappear or die, I should learn to look at an empty sky And feel its total dark sublime, Though this might take me a little time. —W.H.

There is an interesting article on money. Below are some notes.\nBartering is inconvenient because it requires “double coincidence of wants.” This makes it highly inefficient too.\nAs it evolved, money became increasingly symbolic. Money is abstract. It’s a belief system, a language, a social contract. Money is trust. But the rules aren’t written in stone.\nSilvio Gesell: money decays over time.\nthe properties of money — its durability and hoardability — impede its circulation: “When confidence exists, there is money in the market; when confidence is wanting, money withdraws.”\nThus, interest is a private gain at a public cost. In practice, those with money grow richer and those without grow poorer.\n“The merchant, the workman, the stockbroker have the same aim, namely to exploit the state of the market, that is, the public at large,” Gesell wrote. “Perhaps the sole difference between usury and commerce is that the professional usurer directs his exploitation more against specific persons.”\nGesell believed that the most-rewarded impulse in our present economy is to give as little as possible and to receive as much as possible, in every transaction. In doing so, he thought, we grow materially, morally and socially poorer. “The exploitation of our neighbor’s need, mutual plundering conducted with all the wiles of salesmanship, is the foundation of our economic life,” he lamented.\nTo correct these economic and social ills, Gesell recommended we change the nature of money so it better reflects the goods for which it is exchanged. “We must make money worse as a commodity if we wish to make it better as a medium of exchange,” he wrote.\nTo achieve this, he invented a form of expiring money called Freigeld, or Free Money. (Free because it would be freed from hoarding and interest.) The theory worked like this: A $100 bill of Freigeld would have 52 dated boxes on the back, where the holder must affix a 10-cent stamp every week for the bill to still be worth $100. If you kept the bill for an entire year, you would have to affix 52 stamps to the back of it — at a cost of $5.20 — for the bill to still be worth $100. Thus, the bill would depreciate 5.2% annually at the expense of its holder(s). (The value of and rate at which to apply the stamps could be fine-tuned if necessary.)\nIn his book “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,” John Maynard Keynes devoted five pages to Gesell, calling him a “strange and unduly neglected prophet.” He argued the idea behind a stamp scrip was sound. “I believe that the future will learn more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx,” Keynes wrote.\nBook: The natural economic order, 1915\nBook: Jacob Goldstein, Money: the true story of a made-up thing\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20231206/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"first-an-interesting-book-is-coming-the-dream-you-ordered-is-sold-out\"\u003eFirst, an interesting book is coming, The dream you ordered is sold out\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-if-money-expired\"\u003ewhat if money expired?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231128135530/https://www.noemamag.com/what-if-money-expired/\"\u003ean interesting article on money\u003c/a\u003e.

Firstly, we believed that as a result of Government policy, violence by the African people had become inevitable, and that unless responsible leadership was given to canalise and control the feelings of our people, there would be outbreaks of terrorism which would produce an intensity of bitterness and hostility between the various races of the country which is not produced even by war.\nSecondly, we felt that without sabotage there would be no way open to the African people to succeed in their struggle against the principle of white supremacy. All lawful modes of expressing opposition to this principle had been closed by legislation, and we were placed in a position in which we had either to accept a permanent state of inferiority, or to defy the Government. We chose to defy the Government. We first broke the law in a way which avoided any recourse to violence; when this form was legislated against, and when the Government resorted to a show of force to crush opposition to its policies, only then did we decide to answer violence with violence.\nBut the violence which we chose to adopt was not terrorism. We who formed Umkhonto were all members of the African National Congress, and had behind us the ANC tradition of non-violence and negotiation as a means of solving political disputes. We believed that South Africa belonged to all the people who lived in it, and not to one group, be it black or white. We did not want an inter-racial war, and tried to avoid it to the last minute. If the Court is in doubt about this, it will be seen that the whole history of our organisation bears out what I have said, and what I will subsequently say, when I describe the tactics which Umkhonto decided to adopt. I want, therefore, to say something about the African National Congress.\nThe African National Congress was formed in 1912 to defend the rights of the African people which had been seriously curtailed by the South Africa Act, and which were then being threatened by the Native Land Act. For thirty-seven years – that is until 1949 – it adhered strictly to a constitutional struggle. It put forward demands and resolutions; it sent delegations to the Government in the belief that African grievances could be settled through peaceful discussion and that Africans could advance gradually to full political rights. But white governments remained unmoved, and the rights of Africans became less instead of becoming greater. In the words of my leader, Chief Luthuli, who became President of the ANC, and who was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, I quote:\n\u0026ldquo;Who will deny that thirty years of my life have been spent knocking in vain, patiently, moderately, and modestly at a closed and barred door? What have been the fruits of moderation? The past thirty years have seen the greatest number of laws restricting our rights and progress, until today we have reached a stage where we have almost no rights at all\u0026rdquo;, unquote.\nTo continue,\n“We had no doubt that we had to continue the fight. Anything else would have been abject surrender. Our problem, My Lord, was not whether to fight, but was how to continue the fight. We of the ANC had always stood for a non-racial democracy, and we shrank from any action which might drive the races further apart than they already were. But the hard facts were that fifty years of non-violence had brought the African people nothing but more and more repressive legislation, and fewer and fewer rights.\nIt may not be easy for this Court to understand, but it is a fact that for a long time the people had been talking of violence – of the day when they would fight the white man and win back their country, and we, the leaders of the ANC, had nevertheless always prevailed upon them to avoid violence and to pursue peaceful methods. When some of us discussed this in June of 1961, it could not be denied that our policy to achieve a non-racial state by non-violence had achieved nothing, and that our followers were beginning to lose confidence in this policy and were developing disturbing ideas of terrorism.\nIt must not be forgotten, My Lord, that by this time violence had, in fact, become a feature of the South African political scene. There had been violence in 1957 when the women of Zeerust were ordered to carry passes; there was violence in 1958 with the enforcement of Bantu Authorities and cattle culling in Sekhukhuneland; there was violence in 1959 when the people of Cato Manor protested against pass raids; there was violence in 1960 when the Government attempted to impose Bantu Authorities in Pondoland. Thirty-nine Africans died in these Pondoland disturbances. In 1961 there had been riots in Warmbaths, and all this time, My Lord, the Transkei had been a seething mass of unrest. Each disturbance pointed clearly to the inevitable growth amongst Africans of the belief that violence was the only way out – it showed that a Government which uses force to maintain its rule teaches the oppressed to use force to oppose it. Already small groups had arisen in the urban areas and were spontaneously making plans for violent forms of political struggle. There now arose a danger that these groups would adopt terrorism against Africans, as well as whites, if not properly directed. Particularly disturbing was the type of violence engendered in places such as Zeerust, Sekhukhuneland, and Pondoland amongst Africans. It was increasingly taking the form, not of struggle against the Government – though this is what prompted it – but of civil strife between pro-government chiefs and those opposed to them conducted in such a way that it could not hope to achieve anything other than a loss of life, and bitterness.”\n[…]\n“At the beginning of June 1961, after a long and anxious assessment of the South African situation, I, and some colleagues, came to the conclusion that as violence [in this country – inaudible] was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the Government met our peaceful demands with force.\nThis conclusion, My Lord, was not easily arrived at. It was when all, only when all else had failed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us, that the decision was made to embark on violent forms of struggle, and to form Umkhonto we Sizwe. We did so not because we desired such a course, but solely because the Government had left us with no other choice. In the Manifesto of Umkhonto published on the 16th of December 61, which is Exhibit AD, we said\u0026rsquo;, I quote:\n\u0026ldquo;The time comes in the life of any nation when there remain only two choices – submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means in our power in defence of our people, our future, and our freedom\u0026rdquo;, unquote\nThis was our feeling in June of 1961, when we decided to press for a change in the policy of the National Liberation Movement. I can only say that I felt morally obliged to do what I did.”\nRachael:\nI also think what he is saying here is almost indisputably true, as much as some of us would like to deny it. You simply cannot expect people to repeatedly and stoically suffer state violence and the increasing degradation of their political conditions for decades on end without eventually becoming violent themselves, particularly if peaceful protest has become illegal. If people have no sanctioned or permitted avenues to petition states or governments to respect their rights, then asking them to refrain from disruption, illegal activity and violence is asking them to lie down and die. That goes against the core human instinct — yes, there is no way around it. It is literally inhuman to expect people to submit instead of fighting back when they are repeatedly violated.\nConcluding part of Mandela\u0026rsquo;s speech:\n“Above all, My Lord, we want equal political rights, because without them our disabilities will be permanent. I know this sounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. This makes the white man fear democracy.\nBut this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all. It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs as it certainly must, it will not change that policy.\nThis then is what the ANC is fighting. Our struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by our own suffering and our own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live.\nDuring my lifetime I have dedicated my life to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal for which I hope to live for and to see realised. But, My Lord, if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”\nWhy read Mandela now? Two-state solution for both Israel and Palestine. Freedom for both.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20231028/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRivonia 1964 from \u003ca href=\"https://rachaelmeager.substack.com/p/rivonia-1964\"\u003eRachael Meager\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe speech from the dock in the Rivonia trial (1964)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLong Walk to Freedom (1994)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy Mandela and his comrades decided to pursue sabotage and other forms of political voilence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, and the others who started the organisation [Umkhonto], did so for two reasons.

And once they’re in college, maybe you could say, “To get a good job,” but why would a potential hirer care how you did in multivariate calculus if your job doesn’t require any knowledge of calculus?\nI was one of these annoying students. I had the capacity to do well in school but never cared to because I never heard a good answer to this line of questioning. I never understood the point of truly learning the material in hard classes that you’re never going to use in the real world, and I assumed I could goof off and do the bare minimum and get away with it.\nBut I recently realized there is a very good reason to take Calculus. It’s to prove you can do hard things.\nThe ability to do hard things is perhaps the most useful ability you can foster in yourself or your children. And proof that you are someone who can do them is one of the most useful assets you can have on your life resume.\nOur self-image is composed of historical evidence of our abilities. The more hard things you push yourself to do, the more competent you will see yourself to be. If you can run marathons or throw double your body weight over your head, the sleep deprivation from a newborn is only a mild irritant. If you can excel at organic chemistry or econometrics, onboarding for a new finance job will be a breeze.\nBut if we avoid hard things, anything mildly challenging will seem insurmountable. We’ll cry into TikTok over an errant period at the end of a text message. We’ll see ourselves as incapable of learning new skills, taking on new careers, and escaping bad situations. The proof you can do hard things is one of the most powerful gifts you can give yourself.\nMy goal with our kids is to avoid lying to them as much as possible. I won’t tell them that calculus is super important or even that grades are super important. The truth is, they aren’t, so long as you have other plans. Calculus is a great way to prove you can do hard things if you have no other proof to show. But if you’re learning programming and building apps in your free time, or winning soccer championships, or writing a novel, then you are doing hard things. Probably harder than Calculus.\nThis is also why there’s so much survivorship bias and bad advice in the “C students hire A students” trope. Most C students are not doing other hard things instead of school. They’re just goofing off, so they end up working for the A student.\nBut some C students are getting C’s because they’re obsessed with other projects. Hard projects. And that obsession with doing hard things lets them blow past their Excellent Sheep peers over time. So if you have a C student who’s obsessed with something hard, you probably don’t have to worry. If they’re getting high and watching TikTok, well…\nI don’t particularly care what grades my kids get once they start school. But I do care that they consistently prove to themselves they can do hard things. If Calculus is how they want to do it, fine, but there are many, many more options.\nAnd if you’re not someone who knows they can do hard things, find a way to prove it to yourself. Build a habit, learn a skill, create something, whatever it is that turns your default stance on challenges from “that seems hard” to “I can figure it out.”\nCreate proof you can do hard things.\nHere is the original link.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20230817/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a precocious yet nonconformist teenager asks why they need to learn calculus, what should you say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know they will never use it in adulthood, outside of certain career choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could say, “It’ll help you get into college,” but then they’re left wondering why college cares if you know calculus.

After trying to shut down the water to the house with bare hands and his wrench later, he complained that the valve was too old and he could do nothing about it. My heart sank when he told me to call the city. Again. He charged me the dispatch fee of $50 and went to his vehicle.\nSo I called the city and begged them to schedule an appointment as early as possible. It was about 10 days later. Then I saw that the plumber was still in his vehicles. So I rushed out and told him about the appointment and asked if he could schedule the second appointment to match with the city\u0026rsquo;s appointment.\nAfter coming back to the house, I was surprised to find out that the water was shut down.

When I read this line, it is like a lightning strike. For each of us, there are some universial patterns of our experiece in this world. However, it is each of us that makes the whole, loosely connected and remotely located. Yes, there is no such a whole. No one could experience everything in this universe.\n2023-04-20 Another line from Marilyn Monroe\u0026rsquo;s poem runs in the same vein.\nOnly parts of us will ever touch parts of others. Read the excerpt of this poem, the keeper of sheep, by Fernando Pessoa.\nI never kept sheep, But it is as I did watch over them. My soul is like a shepherd, Knows the wind and the sun, And goes hand in hand with the Seasons To follow and to listen. All peace of Nature without people Comes to sit by my side. But I remain sad like a sunset As our imagining shows it, When a chill falls at the side of the valley And you feel night has come in Like a butterfly through a window. But my sadness is calm Because it is natural and right And is what there should be in the soul When it is thinking it exists And the hands are picking flowers without noticing which. At a jangle of sheep-bells Beyond the bend of the road, My thoughts are contented. Only, I am sorry I know they are contented, Because, if I did not know it, Instead of being contented and sad, They would be cheerful and contented. To think is uncomfortable like walking in the rain When the wind is rising and it looks like raining more. I have no ambitions or wants. To be a poet is not ambition of mine. It is way of staying alone. There is ample metaphysics in not thinking at all. What do I think about the world? How should I know what I think about the world? If I were ill I would think about it. What idea have I about things? What opinion do I have on causes and effects? What meditations have I had upon God and the soul And upon the creation of the World? I don\u0026#39;t know. For me, to think about that is to shut my eyes. And not think. It is to draw the curtains Of my window (but it has no curtains). The mystery of things? How should I know I know what mystery is? The only mystery is there being somebody who might think about mystery. A man who stands in the sun and shuts his eyes Begins not to know what the sun is And to think many things full of heat. But he opens his eyes and sees the sun, And now he cannot think of anything, Because the light of the sun is worth more than the thoughts Of all the philosophers and all the poets. The light of the sun does not know what it is doing And so does stray and is common and good. Metaphysics? What metaphysics do those trees have? That of being green and having crowns and branches And that of giving fruit at their hours, - which is not what makes us think, Us, who don\u0026#39;t know to be aware of them. But what better metaphysics than theirs, Which is not knowing why they live And not knowing they don\u0026#39;t know? One wildly clear day, The kind when you wish you had done a pile of work Not to have to do any that day, I caught sight, like a road ahead among trees, Of what may be the Great Secret, That Great Mystery the false poets speak of. I saw that in no Nature, That Nature does not exist, That there are mountains, valleys, plains, That there are trees, flowers, grasses, That there are steams and stones, But that there\u0026#39;s not a whole to which this belongs, That any real and true connection Is a disease of our ideas. Nature is parts without a whole. This perhaps is that mystery they speak of. This was what without thought or even a pause I realised must be the truth Which all set out to find and do not find And I alone, because I did not try to find it, found. I take myself indoors and shut the window. They bring the lamp and give me goodnight, And my contented voice gives them goodnight. O that my life may always be this: The day full of sun, or soft with rain, Or stormy as if the world were coming to an end, The evening soft and the groups of people passing Watched with interest from the window, The last friendly look given the calm of the trees, And then, the window shut, the lamp lit, Not reading anything, nor thinking of anything, not sleeping, To feel life flowing over me like a stream over its bed, And out there a great silence like a god asleep.

It is one of the ways in which the artwork can avoid being consumed too easily. Poems need to thicken their textures and scramble their syntax if they are not to slip down too easily, which is the fate of the commodity. Everyday language is no longer a medium of truth. It has grown stale and threadbare, and only by wreaking violence on it can you force it to yield something of value. Literary modernism sends language on a spree, but that’s because it is so distrustful of it. Jameson has some comments here on Benjamin’s idea of an ur-language, an original speech in which things speak their own names. Then comes the Fall, in which the bond between word and thing is broken. Words become arbitrary signs of things, and language degenerates into a Babel of tongues.\nIf language is no longer to be trusted, you can turn instead to the image. Hence Benjamin’s passion for Surrealism, for which revelation lies in the clash between one image and another. You can take in an image at a glance, but not a narrative. Time is giving way to space, the sequential to the simultaneous. Modernism is among other things a crisis of narration, as the world ceases to be story-shaped. History is no longer informed by the plot once known as progress. Progress and continuity are fictions of the ruling class. They are also the delusions of those socialists who believed that capitalism was doomed to collapse, and that fascism was its death throes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everyday language unfolds in a linear way, and the general view is that history does too. We think of the past as finished and the present as open-ended, but this is not Benjamin’s opinion. In his ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’ it is the past that is incomplete, and the present that has a chance to bring it to fruition. What happens, happens, and does so irretrievably; but the meaning of such events is in the custodianship of the living, so that it is up to us to decide whether, say, a Neolithic child belonged to a species which ended up destroying itself. We can also ensure that those in the past who were defeated in their fight for justice and friendship did not die in vain – that in Benjamin’s phrase, the names of those anonymous men and women will be mentioned in dispatches on Judgment Day. The dead cannot literally be compensated for their suffering, but that suffering can be invested with new significance by our actions in the present. For the moment, then, the meaning of the past remains fluid, and our judgment on it must remain suspended.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Benjamin’s own dark political age is precisely such a moment of danger, one in which the continuity of history is violently ruptured; this opens up a space in which images of past struggles for emancipation can come flooding in. There is a trade-off between past and present: the present can rescue the past from oblivion, while the dead can be summoned to the aid of the living. Time can be looped on itself, as in Proust’s great narrative, to reveal a solidarity of the dispossessed across the centuries. It is the grandest narrative of all, though one that deflates the dream of inevitable progress for which most such tales are notorious. It is certain that the Messiah will come, but he will not arrive like the final note of a triumphal tune. On the contrary, he is the friend of all those who have been crushed and defeated in their day by such triumphalism, and his coming to power will be their victory too.\nMemory, for Benjamin as for Freud, can be an emancipating force, since those who wish to move forward must do so by turning back. In the hands of this most idiosyncratic of Marxists, even nostalgia can become a revolutionary concept. It is tradition that is subversive, not the act of abolishing it. What inspires men and women to revolt, Benjamin remarks, isn’t dreams of liberated grandchildren but memories of oppressed ancestors. His Angel of History turns his back on the future, and hence on all false utopias, gazing with horror at the mounting pile of rubble that is the past. It is not because history is valueless that the angel wants to end it; it is because much of its value springs from exploitation, and the latter weighs more heavily than the former. Hence Benjamin’s much quoted comment that every document of civilisation is also a record of barbarism.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The angel can’t move because his wings have become entangled in a storm, and Jameson seems uncertain about what this storm represents. Benjamin actually tells us: it is the myth of perpetual progress. What stops the angel from waking the dead here and now, calling time on history and ushering in redemption, is the assurance that history needs no such transformation, since it will carry us into a glorious future through its own momentum. It is the colossal complacency known as historical determinism that betrays the need for change.\nBaudelaire writes of the modern as fleeting and contingent on the one hand, and eternal and immovable on the other. Modernism is caught up in the random and provisional, but it is homesick for a time when (so the rumour goes) the absolute and infinite existed. There is an absence at the centre of the modernist work of art where you might just catch a glimpse of truth and reality, firm foundations and stable identities, everything the modern age has supposedly swept away. Postmodernism, by contrast, is too young and brash for such nostalgia. There is no haunting absence in the world. What you see is what you get. Truth and reality are convenient fictions, and identity is invented on the hoof. Modernism should abandon its metaphysical hankerings. As the postmodern philosopher Richard Rorty was fond of remarking: don’t scratch where it doesn’t itch.\u0026rdquo;\nSource: The Marxist and the messiah by Terry Eagleton\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20230205/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In modernist art, obscurity can be a conscious strategy.

In the history of classes, revolution is the act of political creation, while legislation is the political expression of the life of a society that has already come into being. Work for reform does not contain its own force independent from revolution. During every historic period, work for reforms is carried on only in the direction given to it by the impetus of the last revolution and continues as long as the impulsion from the last revolution continues to make itself felt. Or, to put it more concretely, in each historic period work for reforms is carried on only in the framework of the social form created by the last revolution. Here is the kernel of the problem. It is contrary to history to represent work for reforms as a long-drawn out revolution and revolution as a condensed series of reforms. A social transformation and a legislative reform do not differ according to their duration but according to their content. The secret of historic change through the utilisation of political power resides precisely in the transformation of simple quantitative modification into a new quality, or to speak more concretely, in the passage of an historic period from one given form of society to another. Listen to this from Aldous Huxley. In 1958 he predicted a form of dictatorship that would rely not on force, but propaganda - and addiction.\nHere are some great notes on physics.

These things don’t contradict each other but exist on the same thematic and emotional plane. Love and pain, sometimes one and the same Alma and Reynolds will always be floating through time together, their love keeping them afloat yet also trapped in a repeating cycle, forever cursed. Here Paul is a director, Paul Thomas Anderson. He is also known by his initials PTA. Here is a list of his films: hard eight (1996), Boogie nights (1997), mognolia (1999), punch-drunk love (2002), there will be blood (2007), the master (2012), inherent vice (2014), phantom thread (2017) and licorice pizze (2021).\nAlma and Reynolds are two characters in the 2017 movie of Phantom Thread.\nPaul Anderson is an English actor of film and stage. He is best known for portraying Arthur Shelby in the BBC series Peaky Blinders.\nAnother thread. Shakespeare took great delight in confusing the audience about gender, and I’m gonna give you just two examples because I’m waiting for take-out. The famous best example is Twelfth Night, in which a male actor dresses up as Viola, a young woman who dresses up as a young man who falls in love with another man and who is loved by another woman (who is played by a man). But my personal favorite is Othello, when Desdemona’s maid explains women behave badly because they learned all that shit from men, and then you remember both women are being played by men, so the whole scene is really men holding up a mirror and saying “take a long ass look”. Shakespeare used the singular “they” centuries before it became the target of a cultural war, and it’s funny the OP should cite Macbeth because that’s where Shakespeare wrote “Unsex me here” ffs (take out is late).\n\u0026ldquo;when the facts come home to us, let us try at least to make them welcome. Let us try not escape into utopias - images, theories, or sheer follies.\u0026rdquo; By Hannah Arendt\nPierre Bourgault (1934-2003) was a politician and essayist, as well as an actor and journalist, from Quebec, Canada. He is most famous as a public speaker who advocated sovereignty for Quebec from Canada. \u0026ldquo;Speech is a dangerous weapon that one must know how to master so as not to let oneself be mastered by those who master it.\u0026rdquo;\nA poem is a secret shared by people who have never met each other.

Yet still the unresting castles thresh In fullgrown thickness every May. Last year is dead, they seem to say, Being afresh, afresh, afresh.

Betrand Russell is one of them.\n\u0026ldquo;The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich. In the early nineteenth century, fifteen hours was the ordinary day\u0026rsquo;s work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very commonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busybodies suggested that perhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults from drink and children from mischief.\nWhen I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say: \u0026lsquo;What do the poor want with holidays?

It was the moment at which Ireland became officially a western country, fixed in space at last as part of the developed and democratic world. This was all the more important because, unofficailly, it was not quiet either of those things. It was not economically developed in the sense that its new partners like France or Germany were. And its democracy, though institutionally very well established, was not as certain as it looked. It had within it two great subversive forces - its own traditions of violence and martyrdom; and the continuing confusion of citizenship with Catholicism.\nThus, Ireland\u0026rsquo;s entry into the EEC was not quite make-believe, more the other way around. It was an assertion of belief, an act of faith, that in turn would gradually make a reality. It said: this is who we are.

His answer to the question of what reality is could be summarized as follows:\nI grew up in a tradition where there are simply more dimensions to reality: legends and myths and ancestors and spirits and death \u0026hellip; Which brings the question: what is reality? Everyone\u0026rsquo;s reality is different. For different perceptions of reality we need a different language. We like to think that the world is rational and precise and exactly how we see it, but something erupts in our reality which makes us sense that there\u0026rsquo;s more to the fabric of life. I\u0026rsquo;m fascinated by the mysterious element that runs through our lives. Everyone is looking out of the world through their emotion and history. Nobody has an absolute reality.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20221107/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt is easy to forget how mysterious and mighty stories are.

I am standing in the bath tub crying. Mother, mother who am I? If he will just come back once and kiss me on the face his coarse hair brush my temple, it’s throbbing! then I can put on my clothes I guess, and walk the streets. 2 I love you. I love you, but I’m turning to my verses and my heart is closing like a fist. Words! be sick as I am sick, swoon, roll back your eyes, a pool, and I’ll stare down at my wounded beauty which at best is only a talent for poetry. Cannot please, cannot charm or win what a poet! and the clear water is thick with bloody blows on its head. I embrace a cloud, but when I soared it rained. 3 That’s funny! there’s blood on my chest oh yes, I’ve been carrying bricks what a funny place to rupture! and now it is raining on the ailanthus as I step out onto the window ledge the tracks below me are smoky and glistening with a passion for running I leap into the leaves, green like the sea 4 Now I am quietly waiting for the catastrophe of my personality to seem beautiful again, and interesting, and modern. The country is grey and brown and white in trees, snows and skies of laughter always diminishing, less funny not just darker, not just grey. It may be the coldest day of the year, what does he think of that? I mean, what do I? And if I do, perhaps I am myself again.

Samantha Rose Hill once wrote that \u0026ldquo;for Hannah Arendt, hope is a dangerous barrier to courageous action. In dark times, the miracle that saves the world is to act.\u0026rdquo;\nLife is always about hope. Then in an interview, Saidiya Hartman said the follows about the advice of \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t despair.\u0026rdquo; Here is the excerpt: \u0026ldquo;What is joy? What is joy? I tend to describe joy as this experience of transformation or release from the constraint or costume of the individual or the subject into this other form. So, for me I think it’s about floating, it’s about being nothing and being everything at the same time; this sense of the self disappearing in the context of the vastness of the earth, the ocean, the sky, the land. That kind of joy is always about self-dissolution, escape. And my favourite colour? My garden in full bloom. I’m a gardener, so I love the colours in my garden and I love just playing with colours.

In the television programmes, Godard\u0026rsquo;s questions are always straight. They trouble us, the viewers, but not the people they are addressed to. He speaks to the insane in a way which is not that of a psychiatrist or that of a fellow madman or someone pretending to be one. He speaks with workers without being a a boss or another worker or an intellectual or a film director with actors. This is not because he can switch his manner to suit the occasion, because he is a skillful operator, but because his loneliness somehow opens him up to anyone and everything. In a way, it\u0026rsquo;s always a question of stammering.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Loneliness"},{"content":"For the first time someone complained that I swam too fast 记得以前看过一篇文章说游得好自然就快。我不知道自己游得好不好，反正并不快，所以一直在慢的泳道。大学时学会游泳，以前常游。后来有些时间没有条件，也没有时间。最近这段时间我已经坚持游了有近十年，快慢不论，体力还是有的。\n120-year-old singing bird It\u0026rsquo;s amazing like a real bird chirp.\nHorace Mann Die Gewohnheit ist ein Seil.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. **\nCarl Sagan in his book, The demon-haunted world, said something similar:\n~~ Every now and then, I’m lucky enough to teach a kindergarten or first-grade class. Many of these children are natural-born scientists — although heavy on the wonder side and light on scepticism.\nThey’re curious, intellectually vigorous. Provocative and insightful questions bubble out of them. They exhibit enormous enthusiasm. I’m asked follow-up questions. They’ve never heard of the notion of a ‘dumb question’.\nBut when I talk to high school seniors, I find something different. They memorize ‘facts’. By and large, though, the joy of discovery, the life behind those facts, has gone out of them.\nThey’ve lost much of the wonder, and gained very little scepticism. They’re worried about asking ‘dumb’ questions; they’re willing to accept inadequate answers; they don’t pose follow-up questions; the room is awash with sidelong glances to judge, second-by-second, the approval of their peers.~~\nThe Value of Science, by Richard Feynman From time to time people suggest to me that scientists ought to give more consideration to social problems – especially that they should be more responsible in considering the impact of science on society. It seems to be generally believed that if the scientists would only look at these very difficult social problems and not spend so much time fooling with less vital scientific ones, great success would come of it.\nIt seems to me that we do think about these problems from time to time, but we don’t put a full-time effort into them – the reasons being that we know we don’t have any magic formula for solving social problems, that social problems are very much harder than scientific ones, and that we usually don’t get anywhere when we do think about them.\nI believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy – and when he talks about a nonscientific matter, he sounds as naive as anyone untrained in the matter. Since the question of the value of science is not a scientific subject, this talk is dedicated to proving my point – by example.\nThe first way in which science is of value is familiar to everyone. It is that scientific knowledge enables us to do all kinds of things and to make all kinds of things. Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad – but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value – even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.\nI learned a way of expressing this common human problem on a trip to Honolulu. In a Buddhist temple there, the man in charge explained a little bit about the Buddhist religion for tourists, and then ended his talk by telling them he had something to say to them that they would never forget – and I have never forgotten it. It was a proverb of the Buddhist religion:\nTo every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.\nWhat then, is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use.\nBut the key obviously has value: how can we enter heaven without it?\nInstructions would be of no value without the key. So it is evident that, in spite of the fact that it could produce enormous horror in the world, science is of value because it can produce something.\nAnother value of science is the fun called intellectual enjoyment which some people get from reading and learning and thinking about it, and which others get from working in it. This is an important point, one which is not considered enough by those who tell us it is our social responsibility to reflect on the impact of science on society.\nIs this mere personal enjoyment of value to society as a whole? No! But it is also a responsibility to consider the aim of society itself. Is it to arrange matters so that people can enjoy things? If so, then the enjoyment of science is as important as anything else.\nBut I would like not to underestimate the value of the world view which is the result of scientific effort. We have been led to imagine all sorts of things infinitely more marvelous than the imaginings of poets and dreamers of the past. It shows that the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man. For instance, how much more remarkable it is for us all to be stuck – half of us upside down – by a mysterious attraction to a spinning ball that has been swinging in space for billions of years than to be carried on the back of an elephant supported on a tortoise swimming in a bottomless sea.\nI have thought about these things so many times alone that I hope you will excuse me if I remind you of this type of thought that I am sure many of you have had, which no one could ever have had in the past because people then didn’t have the information we have about the world today.\nFor instance, I stand at the seashore, alone, and start to think.\nThere are the rushing waves mountains of molecules each stupidly minding its own business trillions apart yet forming white surf in unison. Ages on ages before any eyes could see year after year thunderously pounding the shore as now. For whom, for what? On a dead planet with no life to entertain. Never at rest tortured by energy wasted prodigiously by the sun poured into space. A mite makes the sea roar. Deep in the sea all molecules repeat the patterns of one another till complex new ones are formed. They make others like themselves and a new dance starts. Growing in size and complexity living things masses of atoms DNA, protein dancing a pattern ever more intricate. Out of the cradle onto dry land here it is standing: atoms with consciousness; matter with curiosity. Stands at the sea, wonders at wondering: I a universe of atoms an atom in the universe.\nThe same thrill, the same awe and mystery, comes again and again when we look at any question deeply enough. With more knowledge comes a deeper, more wonderful mystery, luring one on to penetrate deeper still. Never concerned that the answer may prove disappointing, with pleasure and confidence we turn over each new stone to find unimagined strangeness leading on to more wonderful questions and mysteries – certainly a grand adventure!\nIt is true that few unscientific people have this particular type of religious experience. Our poets do not write about it; our artists do not try to portray this remarkable thing. I don’t know why. Is no one inspired by our present picture of the universe? This value of science remains unsung by singers: you are reduced to hearing not a song or poem, but an evening lecture about it. This is not yet a scientific age.\nPerhaps one of the reasons for this silence is that you have to know how to read the music. For instance, the scientific article may say, “The radioactive phosphorus content of the cerebrum of the rat decreases to one-half in a period of two weeks.” Now what does that mean?\nIt means that phosphorus that is in the brain of a rat – and also in mine, and yours – is not the same phosphorus as it was two weeks ago. It means the atoms that are in the brain are being replaced: the ones that were there before have gone away. So what is this mind of ours: what are these atoms with consciousness? Last week’s potatoes! They now can remember what was going on in my mind a year ago – a mind which has long ago been replaced.\nTo note that the thing I call my individuality is only a pattern or dance, that is what it means when one discovers how long it takes for the atoms of the brain to be replaced by other atoms. The atoms come into my brain, dance a dance, and then go out – there are always new atoms, but always doing the same dance, remembering what the dance was yesterday.\nWhen we read about this in the newspaper, it says “Scientists say this discovery may have importance in the search for a cure for cancer.” The paper is only interested in the use of the idea, not the idea itself. Hardly anyone can understand the importance of an idea, it is so remarkable. Except that, possibly, some children catch on. And when a child catches on to an idea like that, we have a scientist. It is late – although not too late – for them to get the spirit when they are in our universities, so we must attempt to explain these ideas to children.\nI would now like to turn to a third value that science has. It is a little less direct, but not much. The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty – some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain.\nNow, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question – to doubt – to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. Herein lies a responsibility to society.\nWe are all sad when we think of the wondrous potentialities human beings seem to have, as contrasted with their small accomplishments. Again and again people have thought that we could do much better. Those of the past saw in the nightmare of their times a dream for the future. We, of their future, see that their dreams, in certain ways surpassed, have in many ways remained dreams. The hopes for the future today are, in good share, those of yesterday.\nIt was once thought that the possibilities people had were not developed because most of the people were ignorant. With universal education, could all men be Voltaires? Bad can be taught at least as efficiently as good. Education is a strong force, but for either good or evil.\nCommunications between nations must promote understanding – so went another dream. But the machines of communication can be manipulated. What is communicated can be truth or lie. Communication is a strong force, but also for either good or evil.\nThe applied sciences should free men of material problems at least. Medicine controls diseases. And the record here seems all to the good. Yet there are some patiently working today to create great plagues and poisons for use in warfare tomorrow.\nNearly everyone dislikes war. Our dream today is peace. In peace, man can develop best the enormous possibilities he seems to have. But maybe future men will find that peace, too, can be good and bad. Perhaps peaceful men will drink out of boredom. Then perhaps drink will become the great problem whifh seems to keep man from getting all he thinks he should out of his abilities.\nClearly, peace is a great force – as are sobriety, material power, communication, education, honesty, and the ideals of many dreamers. We have more of these forces to control than did the ancients. And maybe we are doing a little better than most of them could do. But what we ought to be able to do seems gigantic compared with our confused accomplishments.\nWhy is this? Why can’t we conquer ourselves?\nBecause we find that even great forces and abilities do not seem to carry with them clear instructions on how to use them. As an example, the great accumulation of understanding as to how the physical world behaves only convinces one that this behavior seems to have a kind of meaninglessness. The sciences do not directly teach good and bad.\nThrough all ages of our past, people have tried to fathom the meaning of life. They have realized that if some direction or meaning could be given to our actions, great human forces would be unleashed. So, very many answers have been given to the question of the meaning of it all. But the answers have been of all different sorts, and the proponents of one answer have looked with horror at the actions of the believers in another – horror, because from a disagreeing point of view all the great potentialities of the race are channeled into a false and confining blind alley. In fact, it is from the history of the enormous monstrosities created by false belief that philosophers have realized the apparently infinite and wondrous capacities of human beings. The dream is to find the open channel.\nWhat, then, is the meaning of it all? What can we say to dispel the mystery of existence?\nIf we take everything into account – not only what the ancients knew, but all of what we know today that they didn’t know – then I think we must frankly admit that we do not know.\nBut, in admitting this, we have probably found the open channel.\nThis is not a new idea; this is the idea of the age of reason. This is the philosophy that guided the men who made the democracy that we live under. The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, and tossed out if necessary, with more new ideas brought in – a trial-and-error system. This method was a result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be a successful venture at the end of the eighteenth century. Even then it was clear to socially minded people that the openness of possibilities was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown. If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar.\nWe are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on. It is our responsibility to leave the people of the future a free hand. In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time. This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant as we are.

To acknowledge resistance as a mass phenomenon is to acknowledge the possibility that something is wrong with the system.\nWhat is new today is not globalization as such—we are too late for that. Rather, what is unique to our times is the widespread awareness of global processes among increasingly fragmented populations. That awareness grows everywhere, largely because of the increase in both the size and the velocity of global flows. Capital, populations, and information move in much greater mass and at increasing speed. At the same time, most human beings continue to act locally.\nThus, we are witnessing the rise of what I call \u0026ldquo;a fragmented globality.\u0026rdquo; World histories and local histories are at once becoming both increasingly intertwined and increasingly contradictory.

Sometimes—most of the time, some would say—we get it wrong. We err on the side of indulgence or cruelty, blind to (blinded by?) our own power. Yet to fail is not to fall into despair. Failing in love, and in criticism, lets us gain a sense of ethical relations: we perceive the conditionality of our judgments, and embrace our capacity to forgive and to be forgiven. Rose puts this better than I can hope to, in lines I often repeat to friends: “There is no democracy in any love relation: only mercy. To be at someone’s mercy is dialectical damage: they may be merciful and they may be merciless. Yet each party, woman, man, the child in each, and their child, is absolute power as well as absolute vulnerability.

Feel something with the followings. One is that Steve Jobs on building a real company. The other is that Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman on competition.\nThe difficult thing to start a business is what to build, what is the feature of a product you really want but can\u0026rsquo;t find. But that\u0026rsquo;s not enough. How can you expand your product into a platform with that particular product. It may start with a niche product. In the end, it may be a platform with your products that everyone uses. If you have a right product, sooner or later you will move to the top. If your product is right, there is no competitons that could win from you. Your products will conquer your competitions. Just remember this: to win a war without fighting is the art. Put out your products there to break the will of others to fight.\nSo few real company builders. Steve Jobs on building a real company: I hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business. That’s how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will stand for something a generation or two from now. That’s what Walt Disney did, and Hewlett and Packard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That’s what I want Apple to be.\nSnowflake CEO Frank Slootman on competition: Patrick: Not all analogies are perfect. They\u0026rsquo;ll often fall down. I\u0026rsquo;m curious to hear where you think the analogy of business as war falls down. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of the Highlander analogy I\u0026rsquo;ve seen you put out there, which I absolutely love. I\u0026rsquo;d love you to tell people that one, because I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of compounding benefits to the market leader. So maybe mention that, what you mean by Highlander as a concept, and what the limits are to this concept of business as war, if any.\nFrank: Government can print money, and they do plenty of it. The rest of us, we have to take it from somebody else. And once you come to that realization, you also find out that they\u0026rsquo;re not going to take kindly to the fact that you\u0026rsquo;re taking this from them. So, and the bigger you get, now you become a looming threat and they\u0026rsquo;ll fight back with everything they have. It does feel like war, and not war in the sense that people are going to die, but companies are going to die. Companies are dying every day. Then they don\u0026rsquo;t reach viability. And then a lot of old ones that were successful, ones that are basically decaying on the vine, I mean, how many of those do we have out there?\nIt is a very visceral battle, but the way you know you\u0026rsquo;re winning, first of all, you need to define what winning is. I\u0026rsquo;ve always quoted US Grant and other people. They defined victory as breaking the enemy\u0026rsquo;s will to fight. It was not just kill them. It was breaking their will to fight. You can do that in a number of ways. But in a world of software, you break the enemy\u0026rsquo;s will to fight when you are hiring their people because they have given up. They\u0026rsquo;d rather be with you than they are with the other company, because it\u0026rsquo;s too hard and too painful and they\u0026rsquo;re not making money. So, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to join the winner instead of stick with delusion.\u0026rdquo; That happens in our world all the time. That is the Highlander analogy because every time the Highlander kills another Highlander, he takes on the strength of the other Highlander. The same thing is true in software. If I\u0026rsquo;m hiring a top salesperson, top engineer from another company, I\u0026rsquo;ve taken their strength now into my organization. It\u0026rsquo;s not just that I gained theirs, but they lose theirs. So it\u0026rsquo;s a double impact. I weakened them and I strengthened myself.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220623/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJust come across the tweets from \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/marcepntoja\"\u003eMarcelino Pantoja\u003c/a\u003e.

The 18-year-old gunman was killed by police. Why tragedies like this happen again and again in the United States? Buffalo, Laguna Woods, Sandy hook, Santa Fe High, El Paso, and so many others.\nMarch 13, 1996. 26 years ago, a gunman entered Dunblane Primary School in Scotland, killed 16 kids and a teacher. The UK government responded by enacting tight gun control legislation. Since then there has been a total of zero school shootings in the UK.\n2 Ten days ago, it took the US Senate about twenty minutes to unanimously pass a bill extending security protection to the family members of Supreme Court justices when it looked like a house might be picketed. It is all a matter of whose families are worth protecting, and for what. They get extensive security, and you get thoughts, and prayers.\nRemember in 2008 that the Roberts Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision \u0026ndash; over a withering dissent by Stevens \u0026ndash; threw out democratically passed gun control laws. They invented a new 2nd Amendment and a false banner to rally around to stop basic protection of children. The lawmakers bear the greatest responsibility. But remember that the Court bears responsibility too. The gunman is never alone.\n3 Then some propose to have more police in the school. But there were three armed people in Uvalde scholl who did not stop the gunman with an AR15. The approach of \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s solve the gun problem with more guns!\u0026rdquo; has never worked. A black father comments that if the school has police, he has to worry about two threats to his kid instead of one.\nIn the school, they train the kids how to respond to the school shooting. How to find a shelter, how to buttress the door, and how to run for their lives. And good luck is in fact the only thing offered.\nThe moment to stop Uvalde was right after Sandy Hook. The US Senate and Congress could stop it right after the very first tragedy, but they chose not to stop it. Why? The obvious reason is their power over the lives of other people\u0026rsquo;s kids.\n4 The existing institutions are always there to protect the rich and the powerful instead of the poor and the weak.\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220525/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"1\"\u003e1\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday 21 people were killed in an attack by a lone gunman at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

How should I act? For what can I hope? What is the human being? This writing has something to do with Kant\u0026rsquo;s last question.\nIn the book of \u0026ldquo;Last Chance to See\u0026rdquo;, Douglas Adams told an anecdote about the Golden Pavilion Temple in Kyoto.\n\u0026ldquo;I remembered once, in Japan, having been to see the Gold Pavilion Temple in Kyoto and being mildly surprised at quite how well it had weathered the passage of time sicne it was first built in the fourteenth century. I was told it hadn\u0026rsquo;t weathered well at all, and had in fact been burnt to the ground twice in this century.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;So it isn\u0026rsquo;t the original building?\u0026rsquo; I had asked my Japanese guide. \u0026lsquo;But yes, of course it is,\u0026rsquo; he insisted, rather surprised at my question. \u0026lsquo;But it\u0026rsquo;s burnt down?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Yes.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Twice.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Many times.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;And rebuilt.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Of course.

It was burnt down.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;So how can it be the same builing?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;It is always the same building.\u0026rsquo; I had to admit to myself that this was in fact a perfect rational point of view, it merely started from an unexpected premise. The idea of the building, the intention of it, its design, are all immutable and are the essence of the building. The intention of the original builders is what survives. The wood of which the design is constructed decays and is replaced when necessary. To be overly concerned with the original materials which are merely sentimental souvenirs of the past, is to fail to see the living building itself.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother smiliar amusing tale is from Terry Pratchett in his book, The Fifth Elephant. \u0026ldquo;This, milord, is my family\u0026rsquo;s axe. We have owned it for almost nine hundred years, see. Of course, sometimes it needed a new blade. And sometimes it has required a new handle, new designs on the metalwork, a little refreshing of the ornamentation . . . but is this not the nine hundred-year-old axe of my family? And because it has changed gently over time, it is still a pretty good axe, y\u0026rsquo;know. Pretty good.\u0026rdquo;\nThen this is also the paradox of the Ship of Theseus.

I suppose so, in the sense that it uses a technical vocabulary specific to his work and the tradition he is working from. These are, most basically: phenomenology, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and Western philosophical history.\nCombined, this leaves us in a position where the objects of his inquiry are varied and risk being construed as overly general. He writes about ethics, politics, language, time, space, forgiveness, the death penalty, sovereignty, Marxism, etc.\nBut there is a through-line that links his approaches to all of these subjects and you probably already know what the word here is: deconstruction. We will look at that in a second but first I want to balance that thought with a qualification\nNamely, Derrida is always writing about specific things. He isn’t writing about ‘language’ he is writing about Plato’s Phaedrus or Austin’s How to Do Things with Words. He isn’t writing about ‘time,’ but about a specific footnote in Heidegger.\nWhich is to say that whatever deconstruction turns out to mean, Derrida never ‘does deconstruction.’ Rather, as he says, he reads texts carefully and they deconstruct themselves. So what does that mean?\nDeconstruction is simple. It is a term used to refer to those cases when conditions for a phenomenon’s emergence are also conditions that render it impossible. D’s work demonstrates that this structure holds across a variety of phenomena.\nSo, e g, philosophical attempts to abolish the death penalty repeat the logic of sovereignty that establish the death penalty’s necessity. Hence Derrida’s claim that even in being abolished, the death penalty will survive.\nOr, to use a famous example, the logic that would privilege speech over writing due to its ostensible immediacy depends on the mediation that typifies writing, thus asserting the anachronistic primacy of writing over speech.\nThis latter is important because it establishes D’s so-called critique of the metaphysics of presence AND establishes the problem of writing as a general problem. In Signature Event Context he applies this argument to ‘experience in general’\nBy ‘impossible,’ then, we really just mean that a given concept, experience, phenomenon, whatever, never coincides with itself fully. It is never present to itself insofar as it depends on a binary that itself cannot be sustained rigorously.\n(In this sense, Derrida is also heir to French existentialism, particularly de Beauvoir’s Ethics of Ambiguity – an under-explored inheritance, in my estimation)\nAnd so Derrida’s work allows us to be rigorous in our critique of texts that seek to establish rigid boundaries and binaries through a thinking of exclusion OR assimilation. And to do so by way of that particular text’s own operation.\nDerrida is really just asking us to be attentive readers in all we do. And he has noticed that when we do so, texts (experiences) tend to become less stable and our inheritances from these allow for greater possibilities to come and which remain.\nQ\u0026amp;A Q: NO! That sounds like you\u0026rsquo;re saying deconstruction is just analysis, which is what bugs me so much about the popular use of the term \u0026lsquo;deconstruct\u0026rsquo;.\nA: I share this worry. I tried here to distinguish deconstruction from the practice Derrida is encouraging, which I here call attentive reading. Deconstruction is not an analysis, as you say, or a method. It is a self reflexive operation of concepts and texts.\nComments The scent of these moments when the impossible is possible, not in the sense that it would become possible, but in a more radical sense in which the impossible, as impossible, is possible. Winston Fettner\nDerrida saying, I never did like the term deconstruction, I love very much everything that I \u0026ldquo;deconstruct.\u0026rdquo;\nSource Further reading Brock Bahler Derrida coined deconstruction. He was inspired by Heidegger’s Destruktion of the history of philosophy. Heidegger was shaped by Luther’s destructio. Deconstruction is at the heart of the Protestant Reformation.\nDisclaimer #1: There are many iterations \u0026amp; variations of what ‘deconstruction’ has come to mean. It would be reductive to try to encapsulate all of them here. Indeed, the very meaning of the term suggests that texts \u0026amp; words have multiple meanings.\nDisclaimer #2: there are HUGE distinctive differences between Luther, Heidegger \u0026amp; Derrida. For one thing, Derrida, a Jew who experienced the effects of anti-Semitism and colonialism, would want nothing to do with Luther’s blatant anti-Judaism or Heidegger’s Nazism.\nScholars, traditions, religions often take ideas from one thinker they disagree w/ \u0026amp; use for a new purpose. But there is a certain spirit that is continuous in Luther \u0026gt; Heidegger \u0026gt; Derrida. Most notably, for ALL of them, deconstruction is a positive phenomenon\nLuther was inspired by Erasmus’s “to the sources!” Luther’s critique of the tradition was initiated by an appreciation for tradition. He thought the trad. had become so dependent on philosophical interpretations that they had stopped looking at what their texts actually said.\nFor Luther, then, “destructio” was BOTH a method of critiquing the tradition but also a passive event, namely, what God does to us. A key point here is that this ‘destructio’ is ultimately positive. Destruction results in edification; our own unmaking results in a new creation.\nHeidegger extracts ‘destructio’ from Luther’s theological context \u0026amp; applies it to his analysis of Western philosophyl tradition, accusing the trad. of getting so comfortable w/ a well-worn def. of Being it ultimately conceals how being is actually revealed in our everyday lives.\nLike Erasmus’ “to the sources” Heidegger [\u0026amp; Derrida] was inspired by Husserl’s “to the things themselves.” That clarion call ushered in the field of phenomenology. He thought a stronger foundation for philosophy could be attained by an appreciation for everyday experience.\nA “destruction” was in order. But not one that despises tradition, but one that invigorates it with new life, one that “should stake out the positive possibilities in that tradition” (BT 22). Destruktion sought to refreshingly open up the tradition to innovation and creativity.\nSo Derrida develops deconstruction. He offered many def. At times, he speaks of deconstruction as passive, as something that happens: texts turn in on themselves, are self-contradictory, \u0026amp; it is precisely from this undecidability that we gain meaning—interpretation is a risk\nMy favorite example is hospitality, a term Derrida discussed. \u0026ldquo;Hospitality\u0026rdquo; comes from the Latin hospes, which we get ‘hospitality.’ But it can also mean ‘foreign.’ Hospes is a combo of two Latin words: hostis \u0026amp; potis. Hostis is where we get the word ‘host’ but ALSO hostile.\nHostis originally meant stranger, but also went on to mean guest, or enemy, or army (as in the KJV \u0026lsquo;Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo;). Potis is were we get the word power. SO hospitality hinges on the paradox of having power to let someone in my house and giving up my power so they enjoy my things\nA radical, pure notion of hospitality (like a Platonic Form) would then be incomprehensible, as if I invited you to my house and then gave you the keys – like the Bishop in Les Miserables who gives Jean Valjean the candlesticks after he stole his silverware.\nAnd hospitality hinges on the dynamic, vulnerable risk of inviting the stranger who might actually be an enemy. That dynamic is most beautifully articulated in the words of Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker who recently survived a hostage situation.\nBut Derrida also spoke of deconstruction as a positive method for reading like Luther and Heidegger. as Catherine Keller summarizes: “To deconstruct is not to destroy but to expose our constructed presumptions.”\nSay you have a favorite book you’ve highlighted. Over time you become so used to the portions you highlighted that that becomes the text, a kind of myth of the full text. A deconstructive reading wonders: what have I missed from the parts that I didn’t highlight?\nBut Derrida saw deconstruction as an act of justice. Consistent w/ the Jewish trad of midrashic interpretation which seeks to discern meaning by reading between the lines, deconstruction asks: Who is missing from this text? What voices have been silenced from this trad?\nWhat are ways in which our reading of texts/traditions have become calcified that they\u0026rsquo;ve been reduced to an algorithm, to a mechanic one-size-fits all law, a hardened past? Deconstruction is an act of justice speaking through the cracks of the law, inviting us to an open future.\nAs John Caputo summarizes, deconstruction is an attempt to open texts and traditions with new life. It is not an attempt to destroy texts/traditions but to preserve them. The conservation of our traditions requires an inherent progressive openness to an unknown future.\nNow before you call this postmodern relativism, one more connection btwn Derrida \u0026amp; Luther: they were both inspired by Augustine. Augustine was shaped by a tradition that thought a good book SHOULD have many meanings not unlike the Jewish trad which says ‘the Torah has 70 faces.’\nIn Confessions bk 12 Auggie doesn’t think original authorial intent is primary. Thinking abt Genesis, he says not only is it impossible to know Moses’ mind, but he might have intended multiple meanings \u0026amp; might not even have been able to foresee all the meanings in his own text.\nEven if we could get the original intent, that’d be useless in itself as it just gives us a bare fact. The goal of reading is not Truth; the goal is the Good. He concludes that many interps. of the Bible should be permitted so long as they contribute to “the fullness of charity.”\nSo when @kkdumez @bethallisonbarr @socofthesacred or @jemartisby and so many other beautiful people asking important questions are slandered for “deconstruction,” I have to say, well none of them are citing Derrida (\u0026amp; none of them are really proposing anything all that radical!).\nBut the spirit of their work IS deconstructive: Projects that don’t want to destroy tradition but take it more seriously by reevaluating \u0026amp; innovating it w/ new life, through a concern for justice, for voices that have been silenced due to a calcified tradition.

Birds sang their morning songs with no stop. On the top, the white peaks of rocky mountians in the west are clear to see. But no one to see but birds.\nMemory is clearly somewhere in our brain. When we remember something, it\u0026rsquo;s somehow printed hard there. If you practise, anything like jogging, swimming, basketball, guitar, violin, or piano, you know how the muscle memory is there. Perhaps in your brain, but also in your legs, arms, and fingers. In this sense, I believe the dualism of mind and body is a false statement. You just cannot distiguish between what is mind and what is body, because they are just indispensable parts of a life. Can you draw a line like a border? No. Do not try to separate them.\nOur body has more than consciousness. It is like a chemical factory running without our knowing anything about it. Our feeelings, our reactions, our desires, and our reasonings are not under our will. They are our will, yet we have no control over them. I believe when we are aging and dying, we are losing the chemical drives little by little. We are chaning all the time. That\u0026rsquo;s why it is really hard to know who we are.\nImagine a pack of wild wolves. They fight. They hunt. They live. They die. It is one wolf before the nature, together with other wolves within a pack. We are alone facing the nature. Then we have a comunity and grow a culture around. We watch. We explore. We read. We inherit a common sense of the society in one language or more. What you can do and what you cannot. Are those the filters and shapers of our desire? Perhaps. The point is that thoughts we may not show and things we may not do are just the surface of our desires, those chemicals running deep in our body.\nOn my way back, say hello to the birds and pat a dog for the first time. I can feel its eagerness to sniff my hands and its strength to play with me. Then wave goodbye to this lady.

Perhaps it is difficult to see the value in having one’s self back in that kind of mood, but I do see it; I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were. I have already lost touch with a couple of people I used to be; one of them, a seventeen­ year-old, presents little threat, although it would be of some interest to me to know again what it feels like to sit on a river levee drinking vodka-and­ orange-juice and listening to Les Paul and Mary Ford8 and their echoes sing “How High the Moon” on the car radio. (You see I still have the scenes, but I no longer perceive myself among those present, no longer could even improvise the dialogue.) The other one, a twenty-three-year-old, bothers me more. She was always a good deal of trouble, and I suspect she will reappear when I least want to see her, skirts too long, shy to the point of aggravation, always the injured party, full of recriminations and little hurts and stories I do not want to hear again, at once saddening me and angering me with her vulnerability and ignorance, an apparition all the more insistent for being so long banished.\nOn keeping a Notebook, Joan Didion\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20211224/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHad my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer.
