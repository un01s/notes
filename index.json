Bit cold and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty soon that my face was numbed. Birds sang their morning songs with no stop. On the top, the white peaks of rocky mountians in the west are clear to see. But no one to see but birds.\nMemory is clearly somewhere in our brain. When we remember something, it\u0026rsquo;s somehow printed hard there. If you practise, anything like jogging, swimming, basketball, guitar, violin, or piano, you know how the muscle memory is there. Perhaps in your brain, but also in your legs, arms, and fingers. In this sense, I believe the dualism of mind and body is a false statement. You just cannot distiguish between what is mind and what is body, because they are just indispensable parts of a life. Can you draw a line like a border? No. Do not try to separate them.\nOur body has more than consciousness. It is like a chemical factory running without our knowing anything about it. Our feeelings, our reactions, our desires, and our reasonings are not under our will. They are our will, yet we have no control over them. I believe when we are aging and dying, we are losing the chemical drives little by little. We are chaning all the time. That\u0026rsquo;s why it is really hard to know who we are.\nImagine a pack of wild wolves. They fight. They hunt. They live. They die. It is one wolf before the nature, together with other wolves within a pack. We are alone facing the nature. Then we have a comunity and grow a culture around. We watch. We explore. We read. We inherit a common sense of the society in one language or more. What you can do and what you cannot. Are those the filters and shapers of our desire? Perhaps. The point is that thoughts we may not show and things we may not do are just the surface of our desires, those chemicals running deep in our body.\nOn my way back, say hello to the birds and pat a dog for the first time. I can feel its eagerness to sniff my hands and its strength to play with me. Then wave goodbye to this lady.

But this is not the last word on this particular technique of living, which is based on the value of love as a means of happiness: there is much more to be said about it.”\nCivilization And Its Discontents, Sigmund Freud, 1930\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20220108/","summary":"“Of special importance is the case in which substantial numbers of people, acting in concert, try to assure themselves of happiness and protection against suffering through a delusional reshaping of reality. The religions of mankind too must be described as example of mass delusion. Of course, no one who still shares a delusion will ever recognize it as such.”\n“We never have so little protection against suffering as when we are in love; we are never so desolate when we have lost the object of our love or its love for us.","title":"mass delusion"},{"content":"Had my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer. Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. Why did the oil refineries around Carquinez Strait seem sinister to me in the summer of 1956? Why have the night lights in the Bevatron burned in my mind for twenty years? What is going on in these pictures in my mind?\nLet Me Tell You What I mean, Joan Didion, 2021\nIt all comes back. Perhaps it is difficult to see the value in having one’s self back in that kind of mood, but I do see it; I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were. I have already lost touch with a couple of people I used to be; one of them, a seventeen­ year-old, presents little threat, although it would be of some interest to me to know again what it feels like to sit on a river levee drinking vodka-and­ orange-juice and listening to Les Paul and Mary Ford8 and their echoes sing “How High the Moon” on the car radio. (You see I still have the scenes, but I no longer perceive myself among those present, no longer could even improvise the dialogue.) The other one, a twenty-three-year-old, bothers me more. She was always a good deal of trouble, and I suspect she will reappear when I least want to see her, skirts too long, shy to the point of aggravation, always the injured party, full of recriminations and little hurts and stories I do not want to hear again, at once saddening me and angering me with her vulnerability and ignorance, an apparition all the more insistent for being so long banished.\nOn keeping a Notebook, Joan Didion\n","permalink":"https://un01s.github.io/notes/posts/20211224/","summary":"Had my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer.
