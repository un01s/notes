Came across several quotes from Henry Ford:

> Money doesnâ€™t change men, it merely unmasks them. If a man is naturally selfish or arrogant or greedy, the money brings that out.

> Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly. It comes as a by-product of providing a useful service.

> The best way to make money is to stop thinking about making money and start thinking about serving people.

> The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.

As Ford says, money does not change men but unmasks them. Power has the same effect. It shows who you really are. It's very interesting to know that both wealth and happiess are just by-products of doing other things such as serving people and creating values for them.

As year 2024 is ending, we see what's right and what's wrong. At the same time, we see what wins and what loses. To fight the darkness, each of us has to hold our own light. That's all we have to do.
