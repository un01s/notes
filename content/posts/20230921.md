Unity claimed that 70% of the top 1000 mobile game developers chose it. Its new policy of installation fee attracts a lot of critism and anger, from indie developers in particular. However, the cause of this is due to the market changes: 

* the market of mobile game has its first decline after 7 years' expansion.
* the population of mobile game stops to increase.

the growth hey-day of mobile game is over. This may be the cause of Unity's new policy, to survive the coming tough time.
