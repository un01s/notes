Kokoro is a 1914 Japanese novel by Natsume Soseki(夏目 漱石). It is the final part of a triology starting with To the Spring Equinox and Beyong (1912) and followed by The Wayfarer (1912). Its title was first printed as Kokoro: Sensei no isho (心 先生の遺書). However, it was usually read as the heart of things.
