"It is unreal to watch some alleged leftists, in real time, fail to recognise a fascist dictatorship attempting to exterminate a liberal democracy, and calling for that democracy to surrender to fascism in the name of peace." I am with Oz Katerji on this.

If we agree Hitler invaded Poland, we have to agree Putin invaded Ukraine. If we stand with Ukraine, we have to send all resources including food, medcine, and arms to help Ukraine to defend themselves, till the victorious end. There is no other choices.

"Arming Ukraine is antifascist solidarity. Calling for Ukraineâ€™s surrender in the face of a fascist war of extermination is bloodthirsty imperialist warmongering. Everyone can see which side you, Ben Burgis, and Chomsky are on. Only the cranks and useful idiots agree with you." Oz Katerji again.
