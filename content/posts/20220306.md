*Think of your mind like a pond full of fish and each fish is a feeling. Try to be the pond, not the fish.* 

Life is nothing but time given to us, short or long. For all of us, a day is long and a year is short. We use our days to trade for years. We trade our time for food, clothes, houses and cars. In the end, time is the only thing we do not have.

Our mind is a pond, and a dream if you read Freud. We have everything there but we cannot have them all. We choose. We struggle. We just want a part of it because the wave of society requires just a part of you. The source of happiness and sorrow, peace and war.
