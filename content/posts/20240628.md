## USA

Last night two old men debated to show their incompetence. Too old and too bad.

Today, "The Supreme Court on Friday reduced the authority of executive agencies, sweeping aside a longstanding legal precedent that required courts to defer to the expertise of federal administrators in carrying out laws passed by Congress." And, "Conservatives have now completed their generational goals of overturning Abortion, Affirmative Action, and Chevron. If y'all don't think Obergefell and gay marriage is next on the chopping block, you must read ..."

The debate was depressing. This ruling is depressing too. The damage from this will be immeasurable in the long run.
