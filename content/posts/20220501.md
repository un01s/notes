## vorld

Vorld is a personal world. V is just a half of W. In your time, the people you have met, the places you have been, the things you have done, these are your vorld. Just a small part of the world. 

## desire 

Lacan has a famous dictum, man’s desire is the desire of the Other. What you want, in the end, is a construct by the vorld from the world. After a chain of choice, you build your desire up. 

## half in half-hearted

In this world, there are always unknowns and uncertainties. Under this constraint, we do things half-hearted. Do good things to help others but never fix the underlying problems once for all. Many bad things happens because of this half-hearted approach. 

Tory has a lot of classic policies doing exactly half-heartedly. When there is a problem, it does not try to solve it but just relieve the plight of poor and dampen radical agitation. In the long run, the ultimate direction is to make the poor poorer.
