Here are some C code with the JavaScript quirks.
Credits to [luna](https://twitter.com/lunasorcery/status/1504893095661424644).

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  puts("-0.5" + 1);
  printf("%d\n", 50 ** "2");
  return 0;
}
```

To build and run the above code, just do the following and ignore the warnings.

```Shell
$ gcc c-js.c && ./a.out
0.5
2500
```

Let's look at the warnings first.

```
c-js.c:4:15: warning: adding 'int' to a string does not append to the string [-Wstring-plus-int]
  puts("-0.5" + 1);
       ~~~~~~~^~~
c-js.c:4:15: note: use array indexing to silence this warning
  puts("-0.5" + 1);
              ^
       &      [  ]
1 warning generated.
```

Now let's explain it.

```puts``` takes a ```const char*``` as the param. ```"-0.5"``` is a string.

```
50 ** "2" = 50 * (*"2") = 50 * ("2"[0]) = 50 * ('2') = 50 * 50
```
The ASCII code of the digit 2 happens to be 50.
