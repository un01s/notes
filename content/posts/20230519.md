In a song by Horslips, you can't fool the beast, there are a few lines interesting.

```
Ah yes, they're blind already.
They're blind to love, blind to pain,
Blind to hope, blind to gain.
Ah you can fool them alright
But can you fool the beast?
```

Love Poem by Robert Bly:

```
When we are in love, we love the grass
And the barns, and the light poles
And the small mainstreet abandoned all nights.
```

Another line from Bill Watterson, the cartoonist of Calvin and Hobbes.

The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive.
