There is going to have the first Dark ID (DID) design. The idea of DID dwelled in my mind for about two years. Now I can finally see its form. I am not sure how others receive it but it's mine, unique to what I am.

This reminds me of one thing that Jorge Borges said in Spanish. "Sólo perduran en el tiempo las cosas Que no fueron del tiempo." After translation, it is roughly as follows: Only things that were not of time endure in time. This I believe applies to not only time, but many other things such as life. What you are is what you are.

If I follow the same line, what Jung said makes sense as well. Your fate is always in your hand. "What is to come is created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you."

Coincidently Tony Bennett said the similar thing. "It sounds so simple, but if you just be yourself, you are different than anyone else." Your identity is always inside you, like a gem, waiting for you to find and shine. The first Dark ID, I am coming.
