每个人的生命都是通向自我的征途，是对一条道路的尝试，是一条小径的悄然召唤。觉醒的人只有一项义务：找到自我，固守自我，沿着自己的路向前走，不管它通向哪里。-- 黑塞

```zsh
I can explain it only by a weakness of the scholarly mind that I have often 
observed in myself. I call it theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted 
a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily 
difficult to notice its flaws.
-- Daniel Kahneman (1934-2024)

[Steve Stewart-Williams](https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/status/1776603981059326084): Psychologists have posited hundreds of cognitive biases over the years. A fascinating recent paper argues that they all boil down to one of a handful of fundamental beliefs coupled with confirmation bias.

[One Bias to rule them all](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/one-bias-to-rule-them-all):

> The fundamental beliefs include such ideas as “I make correct assessments” and “I am good.” And the ultimate bias is confirmation bias: the tendency to seek and favor information consistent with one’s preexisting views.

Here are these [Fundamental belief](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916221148147):

> My experience is a reasonable reference.

> I make correct assessments of the world.

> I am good.

> My group is a reasonable reference.

> My group (members) is (are) good.

> People’s attributes (not context) shape outcomes.

Thought creates the world and then says, “I didn’t do it.” —David Bohm (physicist)

Notes: one life is so short and tiny in the vast universe. this limit is the fundamental source to human bias?
