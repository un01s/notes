## [Satyendra Nath Bose and Enrico Fermi](https://www.quantamagazine.org/matter-vs-force-why-there-are-exactly-two-types-of-particles-20250623/)

Everything is made of a set of just 17 fundamental particles, and those particles, though they may differ by mass or charge, come in just two basic types. Each is either a “boson” or a “fermion.”

Fermions (matter particles)
* Quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom
* Leptons: electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tau, tau neutrino

Bosons (force-carrying particles)
* Gauge bosons (vector bosons): Gluon, photon, Z boson, W boson
* Scalar bosons: Higgs Boson

## [Terence Eden, We’ve got to stop sending files to each other](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/weve-got-to-stop-sending-files-to-each-other/) 

The modern workforce shouldn't be flinging copies to each other. A copy is outdated the moment it is downloaded. A copy has no protection against illicit reading. A copy can never be revoked.

Data shouldn't live in a file on a laptop. It shouldn't be a single file on a network share. Data is a living beast. Data needs to live in a database - not an Excel file. Access should be granted for each according to their needs.
