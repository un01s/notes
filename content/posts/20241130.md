```
Hell is empty
and all the devils are here.

William Shakespeare, The Tempest

> Some believe it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love. J.R.R.Tolkien, The Hobbit, 1937.

> But imprint this on your mind: tolerance becomes a crime when applied to evil. Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain
