“Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.” 
— Hannah Arendt, The Origin of Totalitarianism

## the future computers

there are two types of computers, general and customized. both laptops and severs belong to the former. phones, washing machines, microwave, even cars belong to the latter. you are either a user or a programmer, or both. there are an obvious gap between users and programmers. the question here is if we could remove that gap?

take Excel, the successful spreadsheet application, as an example. it shows you its results as soon as you click to open it. the changes you make show up immediately. you hardly notice that you are a programmer as a user because of its immediate feedback and the hiding of programming related parts. can future computers blur the distinction between a user and a programmer like Excel as an application software?

from [stanislav in 2010](http://www.loper-os.org/?p=284), "the distinction between 'user' and 'programmer' is an artifact of our presently barely-programmable and barely-usable computing systems. I would like to use the neutral word 'operator' instead."
