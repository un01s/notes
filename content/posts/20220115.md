Build some examples in [toit](https://github.com/toitlang/toit) and flash it to [M5Core2](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Core2).

There is no problem to follow the steps in [one toit discussion](https://github.com/toitlang/toit/discussions/5). While trying the step4 for ft63xx. Found a typo in [package.yaml](https://github.com/imliubo/ft63xx-toit/blob/master/examples/package.yaml). mpu6886 should be ft63xx.

Another issue is that the touch seems not working after unplugging the USB cable. Will investigate further. Will try jaguar tool later.
