## a song, night vision, by Suzanne Vega

```
When the darkness takes you
With her hand across your face
Don't give in too quickly
Find the thing she's erased
```

## a poem, a sunday drive, by Margaret Atwood

```
Burial by fire is the last mercy:
decay is reserved for the living.

The desire to be loved is the last illusion:
Give it up and you will be free.
```
