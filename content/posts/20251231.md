## a christmas cat

this year end was definitely different. down for four days and nights with low fevers as I seldom got sick. the weather was pretty cold during the time. it felt colder with fever. then on the christmas eve, early morning, a cat landed on the roof covered with snow and meowed outside at the sill of a window of the second floor.

with a can of fish, the cat was lured down to the ground. it's brown and white mixed with short hairs. quite big and gentle. so it stayed for two days and followed into the house for a warm sleep. so we called a clinic and was told that the clinic could not chekc it up because we were not the owner of the cat. the best we could get is to call the City and send it to a shelter. So in the end, a street cat or dog is owned by the City.

now the problem is when we are going to adopt it. the city called today.
