"I will stay in the fray, in the revel of ideas and risk; learning, failing, wooing, grieving, trusting, working, reposing -- in this sin of language and lips."

"We have to follow not the path of self-enlightening doubt, but the path of despair. ... This path is self-completing because it is more radical than mere doubt, and because it presents the 'complete' forms of 'untrue consciousness in its untruth'."

"This is the counsel of despair which would keep the mind out of hell. The tradition is far kinder in its understanding that to live, to love, is to be failed, to forgive, to have failed, to be forgiven, for ever and ever. Keep your mind in hell, and despair not."

-- Love's Work, Gillian Rose (1947-1995)
