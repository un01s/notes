[Nils Gilman](https://twitter.com/nils_gilman) pinned one tweet: People say adversity reveals character, but I say if you really want to know a man, give hime power.

[Rosa Luxemburg](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/ch08.htm): "In effect, every legal constitution is the product of a revolution."

```
Every legal constitution is the product of a revolution. In the history of classes, revolution is the act of political creation, while legislation is the political expression of the life of a society that has already come into being. Work for reform does not contain its own force independent from revolution. During every historic period, work for reforms is carried on only in the direction given to it by the impetus of the last revolution and continues as long as the impulsion from the last revolution continues to make itself felt. Or, to put it more concretely, in each historic period work for reforms is carried on only in the framework of the social form created by the last revolution. Here is the kernel of the problem.

It is contrary to history to represent work for reforms as a long-drawn out revolution and revolution as a condensed series of reforms. A social transformation and a legislative reform do not differ according to their duration but according to their content. The secret of historic change through the utilisation of political power resides precisely in the transformation of simple quantitative modification into a new quality, or to speak more concretely, in the passage of an historic period from one given form of society to another.

Listen to [this from Aldous Huxley](https://twitter.com/bfcarlson/status/1614957203923812354). In 1958 he predicted a form of dictatorship that would rely not on force, but propaganda - and addiction.

Here is [something about the movie](https://twitter.com/bacon5237/status/1615007725351759872).

```
"Kubrick did in Eyes Wide Shut about the inherent toxicity between men and women built on the western world’s colonial order but Anderson, always an empathist and romantic sees the beauty of their love even as it destroys them."

I think I’m so attached to Paul’s films because they view love as both a healing and destructive enzyme in lonely longing people. These things don’t contradict each other but exist on the same thematic and emotional plane. Love and pain, sometimes one and the same Alma and Reynolds will always be floating through time together, their love keeping them afloat yet also trapped in a repeating cycle, forever cursed.
```

Here Paul is a director, Paul Thomas Anderson. He is also known by his initials PTA. Here is a list of his films: hard eight (1996), Boogie nights (1997), mognolia (1999), punch-drunk love (2002), there will be blood (2007), the master (2012), inherent vice (2014), phantom thread (2017) and licorice pizze (2021).

Alma and Reynolds are two characters in the 2017 movie of Phantom Thread.
  
Paul Anderson is an English actor of film and stage. He is best known for portraying Arthur Shelby in the BBC series Peaky Blinders.


[Another thread](https://twitter.com/doctorcomics/status/1615164808353181696). Shakespeare took great delight in confusing the audience about gender, and I’m gonna give you just two examples because I’m waiting for take-out. The famous best example is Twelfth Night, in which a male actor dresses up as Viola, a young woman who dresses up as a young man who falls in love with another man and who is loved by another woman (who is played by a man). But my personal favorite is Othello, when Desdemona’s maid explains women behave badly because they learned all that shit from men, and then you remember both women are being played by men, so the whole scene is really men holding up a mirror and saying “take a long ass look”. Shakespeare used the singular “they” centuries before it became the target of a cultural war, and it’s funny the OP should cite Macbeth because that’s where Shakespeare wrote “Unsex me here” ffs (take out is late).

 

"when the facts come home to us, let us try at least to make them welcome. Let us try not escape into utopias - images, theories, or sheer follies." By Hannah Arendt

Pierre Bourgault (1934-2003) was a politician and essayist, as well as an actor and journalist, from Quebec, Canada. He is most famous as a public speaker who advocated sovereignty for Quebec from Canada. "Speech is a dangerous weapon that one must know how to master so as not to let oneself be mastered by those who master it."

A poem is a secret shared by people who have never met each other. Charles Simic

I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for one's self depends upon one's mastery of the language. Joan Didion.
