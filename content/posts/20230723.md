"Why are you looking around for help? Do you believe that help will come from outside? What is to come is created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. 
Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you.”

— C.G. Jung
