纽约地铁上黑人流浪汉被谋杀已经有几天了。不少媒体的报道着墨于无家可归，却对大庭广众之下的私刑谋杀轻描淡写，这是很奇怪的事。对弱势群体的同情，似乎被无缘由的（对黑人、贫穷和无家可归者的）害怕和厌恶所取代。

社会学家Matthew Desmond有本书，Poverty by America。在一个访谈中他说，“许多人从贫穷中谋利。”

在百老汇音乐剧Hadestown中有首歌Why We Build the Wall这样唱道：


```
Why do we build the wall?
We build the wall to keep us free ...
The enemy is poverty
And the wall keeps out the enemy
And we build the wall to keep us free
That’s why we build the wall
We build the wall to keep us free

Because we have and they have not
Because they want what we have got
The enemy is poverty
And the wall keeps out the enemy
And we build the wall to keep us free
That’s why we build the wall
We build the wall to keep us free
```
