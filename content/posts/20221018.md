[Brittney Cooper](https://twitter.com/ProfessorCrunk/status/1582741115429494784) posted a question: is it a capitulation to the status quo by making any concessions to Democrats? All comes to the point that we vote in ways to reduce harm. that vote does not means a complete and total yes.

[Adam Davidson](https://twitter.com/adamdavidson/status/1582731925189320705) has something about similarity between smoke and tweet. Go read it. The gist is that big corporations figured out how to abuse our instincts. It may be tweets, smoke, sugar, fat, salts, or others.
