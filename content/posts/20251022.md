Current stock market with AI bubble is much hotter than that dot-com one. Everyone knows that it is going to burst. Just do not know exactly when. 

Meme stocks come back again with the gold price stumbles. What does this mean? Greedy. (Meme stock is just a new trick of old fraud.) Speculations and more speculations. The crash of the stock market is close.
