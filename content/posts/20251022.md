Current stock market with AI bubble is much hotter than that dot-com one. Everyone knows that it is going to burst. Just do not know exactly when. 

Meme stocks come back again with the gold price stumbles (down 3.8% below $4100/ounce). What does this mean? (Meme stock is just a new trick of old fraud.) Greedy and more greedy. Speculations and more speculations. The crash of the stock market is close.
