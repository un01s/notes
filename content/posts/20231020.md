It's been 15 days. On Oct 7, 2023, Hamas launched a terrorist attack against Israel. Then Israel began its retaliatory air strikes to Gaza and its war against Hamas. This war is complicated. Two things should be clear. Hamas's attack to Israel is a terrorist one. Israel shut down water and electricity to Gaza, and bombed hospital and church. It is war crimes against civilians.
