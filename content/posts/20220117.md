Use an Airport to setup a WiFi network. Then download the binary of Jaguar. Run the following commands one after another. The second command requires the WiFi credentials. Use ```CTRL+C``` to stop the third one. To run the forth and the fifth command, put your computer on the same WiFi network as the esp32 device.

```
$./jag setup
$./jag flash
$./jag monitor
$./jag scan
$./jag run hello.toit
```
