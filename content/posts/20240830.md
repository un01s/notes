Business owners spend more time printing business cards than finding clients. People trying to get in shape who buy fancy workout gear instead of exercising. Pretend activity instead of the real thing.

> Ask questions and find the real pain and problems to solve.

Real things have risk. They have the possibility of failure. They have frustration. They force you to confront the possibility that maybe you just arenâ€™t good enough. Fake activity is great for making yourself feel better, but lousy for actual results.

* Nothing is better than something. Fake something is worse than nothing.

* The hard way is the easy way. Direct strike at the problem is the best.

* A meaningful life depends on doing real things.

> Another perspective is porn. However exciting but not real!

> a further question: what is real or fake?
