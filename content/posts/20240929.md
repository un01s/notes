Helene reached the small town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, which is home to the purest natural quartz on Earth. The quartz is used as a crucible to melt polysilicon, which is then used to produce silicon wafers - the base of semiconductor manufacturing. There are two mining companies there, Quartz Corp and Sibelco.

Zygmunt Bauman (1925-2017)
