From the start of COVID-19 pandemic, there are a lot of things happened. Wars are still raging including both Ukraine and Gaza. BLM protests around the world happend after George Floyd was choked to death. During this period, many notable leftists turned right. It is like a deconstruction process. Then I start to read James Baldwin and Hannah Arendt like unlearning or deprogramming.

Just imagine that you had lived and grown in a different place or time, read different books, you might have different expereinces and beliefs. You might convince yourself that your current worldviews are correct. Now the question is that how we know what we know is correct and other people are not? If everyone had a firm stand in his or her views, how are we going to resolve the conflicts among us? So regardless of our difference, we must have an open mind. "The mind is like an umbrella. It's most useful when open."

I have a big dream for 2024. Read more, code more and solder more.
