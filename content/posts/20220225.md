When I started to port the code to ESP32S3 following the example of ESP32C3, I realized I had to read the code closely. Here are the notes along the way.

## Where does the code get started on esp32?

Based on esp-idf, Toit (I like to pronounce it as tight) creates a new platform with a new programming language for developers.

For the code to start on the esp32 device, check all the files inside ```toolchains/esp32/```. They contains all the building details for esp32. Inside its subfolder ```main```, there is a ```toit.c```. The function ```app_main()``` is the entry point. Inside ```toit_start()``` is called.
