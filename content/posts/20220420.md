I have been to several cities in my travel. 

I lived in a city when I was young. In the north, there's my childhood in a rural village and a high school. In the east, that's my home for a while. In the west, I had my best college time. In the south, that's where my girlfriend lived. At that time, the city was still small. I could walk to my grandma's house on my little feet from my school. I could ride a bicycle from west to east and back again on the weekends while studying. Not sure how long it took. It was not exhausting. In the wind, in the rain, in the dusk, and I did remember the yellow ginkgo tree just outside the south gate of city walls in the rain. That shining yellow is my favorite colour.
