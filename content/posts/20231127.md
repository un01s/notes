There are several ways to add artistic touch to the PCB. One way is to use [SVG2shenzhen](https://github.com/badgeek/svg2shenzhen) to create the KiCAD modules. Another way is [Boldport PCBmode](https://github.com/boldport/pcbmode). Both use Inkscape to create SVG. The former is a kind of plugin for Inkscape. The latter is a part of interactive process using Python and has nothing to do with KiCAD. Boldport and Inkscape forms its own process.

Recently I noticed an OSHPark blog that mentioned [another blog by Anne Barela from AdaFruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/making-pcb-art-with-gingerbread-and-kicad). The approach is different from the above. It uses AffinityDesigner, [Gingerbread on Winterbloom](https://gingerbread.wntr.dev), and KiCad. Basically it creates a KiCAD module designed by AffinityDesigner and transformed by Gingerbread.

One thing that I find strange is that the size of module is not exactly as specified in the design. For example, if you follow the procedure described in the above blog, the 25.4mm-square results in 26.2mm one. Thus the PR of changing the width of line from 1 to 0.05mm in my usual KiCAD PCB settings. For the time being, you can open the kicad_pcb file, search Edge.Cuts and change the width of polygon from 1 to 0.05 if you like.
