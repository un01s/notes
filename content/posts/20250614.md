## a fast-forwarded generation

One different idea while reading the book, the idea factory: there are one generation that is fast-forwarded right after the computer is produced. the computer as a machine is so different from industrial machines before, it changed so many things and so many ways of living for the society. so many things happened in such a short period, people are emotionally compressed or starved. the experience is intense. the time to process these experience is not enough. look at the schools, offices, and other workplaces. efficiency is prioritized. human is sacrificed. is it?
