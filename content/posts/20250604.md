First there is a book, The idea factory by Jon Gertner in 2012. Then there is [a blog](https://1517.substack.com/p/why-bell-labs-worked) shown up in the hackernews in early May. At last [another blog](https://fabiomanganiello.com/#social) on that blog. 

> Why Bell Labs worked so well, and could innovate so much, while today’s innovation, in spite of the huge private funding, goes in hype-and-fizzle cycles that leave relatively little behind? A sad note is Bell Labs's rate of innovation fizzled out after 1980s.

> Bell Labs did have plenty of funding. But this is not the main reason. First of all, Bell and Kelly had an innate talent in spotting the “geekiest” among us. And they knew NOT to manage them. According to Kelly's golden rule: "How do you manage genius? You don't." As Kelly eloquently put it: “What stops a gifted mind from just slacking off?” is the wrong question to ask. The right question is, “Why would you expect information theory from someone who needs a babysitter?”

> MBA graduates and CEOs destroyed the spirit of scientific and engineering ingenuity not because they are evil but because the financial incentives changed drastically from the times of Bell Labs. Nobody expected a single dime of profits to come out from the Bells Labs. The America that invested into the Bell Labs and into the Apollo project was very different from today’s America.

> And, since nobody was expecting a dime back from Bell, nobody would put deadlines on talented people, nobody hired unqualified and arrogant business specialists to micromanage them, nobody would put them on a performance improvement plan if they were often late at their daily standups or didn’t commit enough lines of code in the previous quarter. So they had time to focus on how to solve some of the most complex problems that humans ever faced. So they could invent the transistor, the programming infrastructure still used to this day, and lay the foundations of what engineers study today. Tech has become all about monetization nowadays and nothing about ingenuity.

Another side note: Chicago macro-economic theory rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macro-economics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations. 

Neoliberalism is a political and economic ideology that advocates for free-market capitalism, which became dominant in policy-making from the **late 20th century onward**. It originated among European liberal scholars during 1930s shaped bt Great Depression. It is designed to counter the volatility of free markets.

In the context of policymaking, neoliberalism is often used to describe a paradigm shift that was said to follow the failure of the post-war consensus and neo-Keynesian economics to address the stagflation of the 1970s, though the causal factors were purely external, which no economic modality has shown to be able to handle. The Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War also facilitated the rise of neoliberalism in the United States, the United Kingdom and around the world.
