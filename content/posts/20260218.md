what i am looking for? something to let me see through the bullshits that the news and books and persons are piling on and to know and live my life truely. both covid and blm gave us a peek. now the control and release of epstein files just exposed a little about epstein-gang.

respiciendo prospiciendo = looking forward looking back

* more and less:The richest man is not who has the most, but who needs the least.

* past and future: El pasado siempre vuelve, pero nunca vuelve como lo esperamos. 过去总会重来，但从不会以我们期望的方式重来。

* 存在即合理：黑格尔：凡是合乎理性的，终将实现为现实；凡是真正的现实，必然蕴含理性。

* 时来天地皆同力，运去英雄不自由。-- 罗隐《筹笔驿》

## poem by wildred: to one who would make a confession

```
Oh! leave the past to bury its own dead. 
The past is naught to us, the present all. 
What need of last year's leaves to strew Love's bed? 
What need of ghosts to grace a festival? 
I would not, if I could, those days recall, 
Those days not ours. For us the feast is spread. 
The lamps are lit, and music plays withal. 
Then let us love and leave the rest unsaid. 
This island is our home. Around it roar 
Great gulfs and oceans, channels, straits and seas. 
What matter in what wreck we reached the shore,  
So we both reached it? We can mock at these. 
Oh! leave the past, if past indeed there be; 
I would not know it; I would know but thee.
```

## poem by wilfred: On the shortness of time

```
If I could live without the thought of death, 
Forgetful of Time's waste, the soul's decay, 
I would not ask for other joy than breath, 
With light and sound of birds and the sun's ray. 
I could sit on untroubled day by day 
Watching the grass grow, and the wild flowers range 
From blue to yellow and from red to grey 
In natural sequence as the seasons change. 
I could afford to wait, but for the hurt 
Of this dull tick of time which chides my ear. 
But now I dare not sit with loins ungirt 
And staff unlifted, for death stands too near. 
I must be up and doing -- ay, each minute. 
The grave gives time for rest when we are in it.
```

## poem by wilfred

```
A prison is a convent without God. 
Poverty, Chastity, Obedience 
Its precepts are. In this austere abode 
None gather wealth of pleasure or of pence. 
Woman’s light wit, the heart’s concupiscence 
Are banished here. At the least warder’s nod 
Thy neck shall bend in mute subservience. 
Nor yet for virtue – rather for the rod.
```

If wealth was the inevitable result of hard work and enterprise, every woman I Africa would be a millionaire. — George Monbiot. The self-attribution fallacy

> Most religions have their central texts.  For christians it's the Bible, for muslims it's the Quran, for us atheists it's Batman comic books. They are all wide open to misinterpretation.

the point is open to interpretation such as laws and constitutions in the USA

## iterative awakening or iterative interpretation

Understanding is an iterative process. Write code, run, think, write some more. No-one ever came up with a design, wrote the code, compiled then shipped.

Layers of time: to reach the start of time, to reach the start of human society. There is no place in the time not moving back. The reach is all in your mind.
Civilization is layers of abstraction upon each other built along the time. The origin of it is already lost in the deep time. The problem is how to continue and how to adapt.

Freedom is a great appeal to all who are oppressed. Is it that all men are felt oppressed? Two forces are fighting for freedom at the same time. One is battling for the freedom of privilege. The other the freedom of not being oppressed.
The ultimate issue of freedom and equality lies in the power structure. The change in this structure generates new privileges. Marx looked at the outside and Freud looked into the inside. The problem at hand is freedom. Marx tried to show the outside shackles while Freud the inner potential. 马克思求诸于外，弗洛伊德探求于内。要获得终极的自由，必须先认清束缚在人身的内外双重枷锁。

More slaves, more land, and more money. Why more? Will more of something solve our problems for one or for all? The ultimate problem is not them versus us but all ourselves.
 
Labor division is the base of ruling in any society including capitalism. What a society needs is not only division but the combination. 干净的手，文明的嘴和清醒的脑需要集于一身，而不是分散在多人。the difficulty of communication is two persons stayed at the different stages of awakening or growth or world/environment internalization. To put it simply, two persons at the same place but different time.  剥削的本质就是雇佣了一个完整的人却只支付了部分如某项技能的费用。from slave to slave.

追寻人生的真相或许是个幻想，从时间或从地域、向内或向外，最主要的问题是人自己在变，而世界也同时在变。没有写在书中或画在纸上的真相。

> All America lies at the end of the wilderness road, and our past is not a dead past, but still lives in us. Our forefathers had a civilization inside themselves, the wild outside. We live in the civilization they created, but within us the wilderness still lingers. What they dreamed, we live, and what they lived, we dream. — T.K. Whipple, Study out the Land
