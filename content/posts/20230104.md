Two nice tweets from [Steve Stewart-Williams](https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/). One is [the brain](https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/status/1610652272823861250). The other [Physics is weird](https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/status/1610515988662951936).

Another thing is geometry in p5js in [this github repo](https://github.com/v3ga/dessins_geometriques_et_artistiques). Beautiful geometric shapes generated by code.
