"It's not true that fate slips silently into our lives. It steps in through the door that we have opened, and we invite it to enter. No one is strong enough or cunning enough to avert by word or deed the misfortune that is rooted in the iron laws of his character and his life."

-- Sandor Marai, Embers

“The words we read and words we write never say exactly what we mean. The people we love are never just as we desire them. The two symbola never perfectly match. Eros is in between.” 

-- Anne Carson, Eros the Bittersweet

We must bring
our own light
to the darkness.

nobody is going
to do it
for us.

-- Bukowski
