## design of a product

To design a successful product is an iterative process. How to get it right? Here are two pieces of advice. [One](https://www.founderstribune.org/p/if-your-product-is-great-it-doesn-t-need-to-be-good-by-paul-buchheit) is from the Gmail creator Paul Buchheit.

> What's the right approach to new products? Pick three key attributes or features, get those things very, very right, and then forget about everything else. Those three attributes define the fundamental essence and value of the product -- the rest is noise. For example, the original iPod was: 1) small enough to fit in your pocket, 2) had enough storage to hold many hours of music and 3) easy to sync with your Mac (most hardware companies can't make software, so I bet the others got this wrong). That's it -- no wireless, no ability to edit playlists on the device, no support for Ogg -- nothing but the essentials, well executed.

> By focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essence and value of the product. If your product needs "everything" in order to be good, then it's probably not very innovative (though it might be a nice upgrade to an existing product). Put another way, if your product is great, it doesn't need to be good.

Another is from [Wil Chung's Post](https://interjectedfuture.com/visual-programming-is-stuck-on-the-form/): form follows function.

> Underlying great creations that you love—be it music, art, or technology—its form (what it looks like) is driven by an underpinning internal logic (how it works). I noticed this pattern while watching a talk on cellular automaton and realized it's "form follows function" paraphrased from a slightly different angle. Inventing a form is a hard task, so you must approach it obliquely—by first illuminating the underlying function.

> When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan's "form follows function," what they meant was, form should follow function. And if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it, because there is no effort to spare for error.

So in the end, who creates the future?

> "The future is not shaped by people who don't really believe in the future. Men and women of vitality have always been prepared to bet their futures, even their lives, on ventures of unknown outcome. If they had all looked before they leaped, we would still be crouched in caves sketching animal pictures on the wall."

## V for Vendetta

> Alan Moore: We are told to remember the idea and not the man. Because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten. But 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I have witnessed firsthand the power of ideas. I've seen people kill in the name of them. But you cannot kiss an idea... cannot touch it or hold it. 

> Ideas do not bleed. They do not feel pain. They do not love. And it is not an idea that I miss. It is a man. 

> A man that made me remember the 5th of November. A man that I will never forget.

> People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.

> Behind this mask there is more than just flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea... and ideas are bulletproof.
