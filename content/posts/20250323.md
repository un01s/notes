* [this is a good piece of advice for investment](https://jasonzweig.com/saving-investors-from-themselves-2/). it was written in November 2014 by [Jason Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Zweig).

> I was once asked, at a journalism conference, how I defined my job. I said: My job is to write the exact same thing between 50 and 100 times a year in such a way that neither my editors nor my readers will ever think I am repeating myself.

> That’s because good advice rarely changes, while markets change constantly. The temptation to pander is almost irresistible. **And while people need good advice, what they want is advice that sounds good.**

> The advice that sounds the best in the short run is always the most dangerous in the long run. Everyone wants the secret, the key, the roadmap to the primrose path that leads to El Dorado: the magical low-risk, high-return investment that can double your money in no time. Everyone wants to chase the returns of whatever has been hottest and to shun whatever has gone cold. Most financial journalism, like most of Wall Street itself, is dedicated to a basic principle of marketing: When the ducks quack, feed ‘em.

> As the founder of security analysis, Benjamin Graham, wrote in The Intelligent Investor in 1949: **“The investor’s chief problem – and even his worst enemy – is likely to be himself.”**

> From financial history and from my own experience, I long ago concluded that **regression to the mean is the most powerful law in financial physics**: Periods of above-average performance are inevitably followed by below-average returns, and bad times inevitably set the stage for surprisingly good performance.

> But humans perceive reality in short bursts and streaks, making a long-term perspective almost impossible to sustain – and making most people prone to believing that every blip is the beginning of a durable opportunity.

> My role, therefore, is to bet on regression to the mean even as most investors, and financial journalists, are betting against it. I try to talk readers out of chasing whatever is hot and, instead, to think about investing in what is not hot. Instead of pandering to investors’ own worst tendencies, I try to push back. My role is also to remind them constantly that knowing what not to do is much more important than what to do. Approximately 99% of the time, the single most important thing investors should do is absolutely nothing.

> “No individual can assist or save the age. He can only express that it is lost.” Without a moment’s hesitation, my dad retorted: “He’s right. But that’s exactly why you must try to assist and save the age.”

I guess this is another way to say that "the pessimist is right but the optimist wins."

* Another piece of advice from C.S.Lewis: “Write about what really interests you, whether it is real things or imaginary things, and nothing else."

* In the end, the fact of the matter is: if you want to be good, you really don't have a lot of choices. Cause it takes what it takes.
