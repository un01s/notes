## sergei yesenin (1895-1925)

"bitter tears" of the "evening silence", translated by Anton Yalovlev, The Last Poet of the Village.

```
In this world you can
search for everything,
except Love and death. 
They find you when the 
time comes.
```

* another long poem

```
Is it my fault that I’m a poet
Of heavy suffering and bitter fate?
After all, it wasn’t my choice—
It’s just the way I came into the world.

Is it my fault that I don’t cherish life,
That I love and simultaneously hate everyone,
And know things about myself I don’t yet see—
That is my gift from the muse.

I know there is no happiness in life,
Life is lunacy, the dream of a sick soul,
And I know my gloomy tunes bore everyone,
But it’s not my fault—that’s the kind of poet I am.

I will not lie to myself,
Woe has settled in my misty heart.
Why am I known as a charlatan?
Why am I known as a brawler?
 
I’m not a villain. I haven’t robbed anyone in the forest.
I haven’t shot wretches in dungeons.
I’m merely a street rake
Smiling at passing faces.
 
I’m a mischievous Moscow playboy.
In Tver, every neighborhood dog
Recognizes my breezy gait
In the backstreets.
 
Every bedraggled horse
Nods its head to greet me.
I’m a good friend to the animals,
Healing them with my verses.
 
My top hat is not to impress the women.
My heart can’t bear meaningless passion.
It makes it easier, soothing my sadness,
To give gold oats to a mare.
 
I have no friends among people.
I’m loyal to a different kingdom.
I’m ready to put my best tie
On the neck of any local hound.
 
Now I won’t hurt any longer.
Swamp is drained in my murky heart.
This is why I’m known as a charlatan.
This is why I’m known as a brawler.

The rude are destined for joy; 
The tender are destined for sadness.  
I pity nothing;
I pity no one.

I pity myself a bit;
I pity stray dogs.
This path has led me straight 
To a tavern.  

Why are you yelling, you devils?
Am I not my country’s son?
Everyone here has pawned
His pants for a drink.

Hazy eyed, I look out the window;
My heart is heavy and hot.
The street in front of me, 
Wet from sunlight, rolls on.  

There is a boy in the street. 
The air is fried and dry.  
The boy is so contented
And picks his nose.

Go right ahead, my dear, 
Get your whole finger in there, 
Just don’t burrow into your soul 
With the same force.  

I’m toast… My courage is failing…
Look at my host of bottles!
I collect corks to plug 
The holes in my soul.
```

Separation
BY W. S. MERWIN

Your absence has gone through me
Like thread through a needle.
Everything I do is stitched with its color.
```

* the second one

```
Rain Light
By W.S. Merwin

All day the stars watch from long ago
my mother said I am going now
when you are alone you will be all right
whether or not you know you will know
look at the old house in the dawn rain
all the flowers are forms of water
the sun reminds them through a white cloud
touches the patchwork spread on the hill
the washed colors of the afterlife
that lived there long before you were born
see how they wake without a question
even though the whole world is burning
```
