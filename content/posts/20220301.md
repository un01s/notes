After ```toit_start()```, we have ```toit_esp32.cc``` to read. The first one is ```toit::start()```. Toit here is just a namespace. As we know that toit supports OTA (over-the-air update) through WiFi and esp32 device is set to be a station (STA instead of AP).

What we have here is as follows:

* RtcMemory::set_up();
* FlashRegistry::set_up();
* OS::set_up();
* esp_partition_find_first();
* setup_program(support_ota);
* Scheduler::ExitState exit_state;
* VM vm;
* vm.load_platform_event_sources();
* int groud_id = vm.scheduler()->next_group_id();
* exit_state = vm.scheduler()->run_boot_program(program, null, group_id);
* OS::tear_down();
* FlashRegistry::tear_down();

After these, esp32 may go to deep sleep.
