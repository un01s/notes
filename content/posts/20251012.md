[Xray](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) config to set up a proxy server as DNS server with port 53 exposed.

```
{
  "outbounds": [
    {
      "tag": "proxy",
      "protocol": "vless",
      "settings": {
        "vnext": [
          {
            "address": "our-proxy-server-domain",
            "port": 53,
            "users": [
              {
                "id": "some-uuid",
                "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision",
                "encryption": "none",
                "level": 0
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "streamSettings": {
        "network": "tcp",
        "security": "tls",
        "tlsSettings": {
          "allowInsecure": false,
          "allowInsecureCiphers": false,
          "alpn": [
            "h2"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "tag": "direct",
      "protocol": "freedom"
    },
    {
      "tag": "block",
      "protocol": "blackhole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then use Xray client connects to this proxy server. 

```
$ curl -v github.com -x socks5://127.0.0.1:10810
```

Not all services over port 53 are DNS request. [A client to DNS tunnel](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine).

Add paid users' MAC address to the white list of gateway.

MAC address is made up by the computer itself. Then use ARP (address resolution protocol) to inform the gateway. To get the MAC address, the gateway broadcast the ARP request with IP address. That is, use IP address to get the MAC address.

Small numbers are easy to grasp like birthday and age. But big numbers are hard like billions of stars and million years of ice age. Still we like numbers.

## we see what we could see, at most the image of the world

when I finished the book, Too Much of Life: the Complete Cronicas by Clarice Lispector, at the end of the book, there is one by her son. The book is bascially all her column articles called cronicas.

> Writing this reminds me of a philosopher, doubtless Greek, who said that people never actually see themselves, that the most anyone sees is their own reflection in a mirror. This idea was given physical form by one of my favorite painters, Rene Magritte, who painted a picture featuring a perfect representation of a pipe under which he wrote in large letters "this is not a pipe" -- a careful observer of the painting would conclude that it was not a pipe, but an image of a pipe.

> In the sense that people sometimes do not know the thing itself, but only its image, I hope that these few breif thoughts may contribute somewhat to a wider knowledge of the story behind Clarice's cronicas.
