After reading the Rivonia 1964, you have to admire Mandela and how fortunate South Africa had Mandela at that time. Look at Gaza now. The terrorist attack by Hamas seemed such a desperate choice when there was no choice left. Will Israel stop its war against Hamas? Will both Israel and Palestine return to two-state solution? 

When Russia invaded Ukraine, US stands with Ukraine. When Israel invaded Palestine, US stands with Israel. Hamas is a group of terrorists. That is not a question. But why had so many Palestinian civilians to be killed?
