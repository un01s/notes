Telescope 
Louise Glück

There is a moment after you move your eye away 
when you forget where you are 
because you’ve been living, it seems, 
somewhere else, in the silence of the night sky.

You’ve stopped being here in the world. 
You’re in a different place, 
a place where human life has no meaning.

You’re not a creature in body. 
You exist as the stars exist, 
participating in their stillness, their immensity.

Then you’re in the world again. 
At night, on the cold hill, 
taking the telescope apart.

You realize afterward 
not that the image is false 
but the relation is false.

You see again how far away 
every thing is from every other thing.
```

It is such a beautiful peom.
