T to S and S to L = sex is the drive of life, testosterone is the drive of sex

Here are two articles on testosterone:

[Oct 22, 2025 web archive: Testosterone is giving women back their sex drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20251023020416/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/magazine/testosterone-women-health-sex-libido-menopause.html)

HRT = hormone replacement therapy,
TRT = testosterone replacement treatment,
hormone imbalance,
hormone disorders

>  To be specific, they say "religious communities that strongly oppose gender-affirming care", but what they mean is "religious communities that strongly oppose gender-affirming care for trans people". Because they're bigots.

> My blood test showed low testosterone: GoodRx for about $160/year

> It's pretty wild how dependent older women are on hormone replacement therapy and how little awareness there seems to be that HRT getting banned for trans people may very well have the side effect that it's banned, or at least harder to get and/or more expensive, for us old ladies too.

> [Frank Wilhoit commented on Conservatism March 22, 2018](https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288): Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: **There must be in-groups whom the law protectes but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect. There is nothing more or else to it, and there never has been, in any place or time.**

> Noam Chomsky: In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to these policies. As is most of the population.

Politics is nothing but maintaining order. "There is no such thing as liberalism — or progressivism, etc. There is only conservatism. No other political philosophy actually exists; by the political analogue of Gresham’s Law, conservatism has driven every other idea out of circulation."

[Gresham's Law: Bad money drives out good 劣币驱逐良币]: In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good". For example, if there are two coins in circulation containing metal of different value, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable coin based on the inherent value of its component metals will gradually disappear from circulation. 

> “The king can do no wrong.” In practice, this immunity was always extended to the king’s friends, however fungible a group they might have been. Today, we still have the king’s friends even where there is no king (dictator, etc.). Another way to look at this is that the king is a faction, rather than an individual.

> So this tells us what **anti-conservatism** must be: the proposition that the law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone, and cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.

** The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone; and it cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone. **

Guess the freedom for one group is not freedom but privilege. The freedom for everyone is true freedom.
