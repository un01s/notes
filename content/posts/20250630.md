Ithaka
C.P. Cavafy, translated by Edmund Keeley

As you set out for Ithaka
hope your road is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:
you’ll never find things like that on your way
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,
as long as a rare excitement
stirs your spirit and your body.
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them
unless you bring them along inside your soul,
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.

Hope your road is a long one.
May there be many summer mornings when,
with what pleasure, what joy,
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations
to buy fine things,
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
sensual perfume of every kind—
as many sensual perfumes as you can;
and may you visit many Egyptian cities
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.

Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.
But don’t hurry the journey at all.
Better if it lasts for years,
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.
Without her you wouldn't have set out.
She has nothing left to give you now.

And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.

伊萨卡岛

【希腊】卡瓦菲

当你启程前往伊萨卡，
愿你的道路漫长，
充满奇迹，充满发现。
吃人的巨人，独眼的巨人，
愤怒的波塞冬海神——不要怕他们，
你的路上不会有怪物，
只要你心气高扬，
只要那宝贵的兴奋，
在你的身心中翻涌。
吃人的巨人，独眼的巨人，
狂暴的波塞冬海神——你将无缘遇见，
除非你在灵魂中滋养它们，
除非你的灵魂让他们立在面前。

愿你的道路漫漫，
愿夏日的清晨常驻当你
带着欢乐，带着欣喜，
进入初次相见的海港。

愿你在腓尼基人的集市停留，
购买精美的物件，
珠母和珊瑚，琥珀和黑檀，
迷人的香水，各种各样，
迷人的香水，尽情挑选。
愿你拜访埃及众城，
一一请教先贤。

让伊萨卡常在你心间，
那里是你注定的终点。
但别急着匆忙赶路，
最好让旅程持续多年。
而你登岛时已然苍老，
带着一路所得的财富，
对伊萨卡已无期盼。

伊萨卡曾赐予你神奇的旅行，
没有她你不会扬起风帆，
而今，她没有什么再可给你。

若你发现她贫瘠，她从未曾骗你，
当饱经风霜，领悟睿智，
你就会明白伊萨卡人的真意。
