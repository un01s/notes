## lung-gom-pa

You must be curious about what [lung-gom-pa](https://theamericanscholar.org/how-to-live-with-dying/) is. It is an ecstatic state: running in a trance, just like lungs-on-legs. 

> Albert Camus: In the depth of winter I learned that there lay within me an invincible summer.

> Albert Camus: what if Sisyphus is happy? La lutte elle-même vers les sommets suffit à remplir un cœur d'homme; il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux. The struggle itself towards the summit is enough to fill a man's heart; you have to imagine Sisyphus happy.

Then I realize that Camus has many quotes worthy of noting as below:

> Camus: You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

> Camus: Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.

> Camus: Live to the point of tears.

> Camus: Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.

## [why don't more people use Linux?](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-don-t-more-people-use-linux-33b75f53)

If Linux is so good, why aren't more people using it?
If exercising is so healthy, why don't more people do it?
If reading is so educational, why don't more people do it?
If junk food is so bad for you, why do so many people eat it?

Programmers are different. Not because it (Linux, for example) is easy, but because it is worth it.
