## effects of climate change

if the climate changes continue, one effect is that the sea level will rise and some islands in the ocean could be submegered. that is an existential crisis for people living there. now Iceland declared that the potential collapse of a major Atlantic current system could alter the country's climate and economy. that is another effect of climate change. some places get colder and other places warmer. extreme conditions become more frequent due to climate change.

## [protobuf, or protocol buffer is better than JSON?](https://aloisdeniel.com/blog/better-than-json)

* API: application programming interface

An API is a set of rules that allow two systems to communicate. For example, in the web, REST APIs use the HTTP protocol and its methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE ...) to communicate. A request message may contain a header, a body and a response status. Inside the header, there is a field of ```Content-Type``` that specifies the message format such as JSON, XML, Protobuf, etc. **Serialization** is a process that turns a data structure into a sequence of bytes that can be transmitted.

* why JSON is so popular?

  * human readable
  * perfectly integrated into the web
  * flexible
  * tools everywhere

With JSON, you often send ambiguous or non-guaranteed data. you may encounter a missing field, an incorrect type, a typo in a key, or simply an undocumented structure. With Protobuf, that's impossible. 

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message User {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  bool isActive = 4;
}
```

Each field has a strict type, a number identifier, and a stable name.

* code generation for protobuf

```
protoc --dart_out=lib user.proto
final user = User()
  ..id = 42
  ..name = "Alice"
  ..email = "alice@example.com"
  ..isActive = true;

final bytes = user.writeToBuffer();       // Binary serialization
final sameUser = User.fromBuffer(bytes);  // Deserialization
```

It works with Dart, TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift, C#, Go, Rust, and many more. no manual validation required.

Another strength of Protobuf is that it's a binary format. Easy and efficient for serialization.

## [dillo browser](https://dillo-browser.org/)

dillo is a fast and small graphical web browser

* multiplatform (linux, BSD, macOS, etc.)
* written in C and C++
* low memory usage
* support for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and local files
* extensible
* GPLv3

## Albert Einstein, and modern physics

爱因斯坦的相对论，是奠定了宇宙宏观尺度的地基和框架（引力、时空几何、宇宙学）。而玻尔、海森堡、薛定谔、狄拉克等人创建的量子力学，则是奠定了微观世界的地基和框架。从影响力来看，相对论和量子力学的影响辐射到几乎所有物理分支，甚至哲学。

霍金的成就主要体现在黑洞物理学和宇宙学领域，其伟大之处在于他将广义相对论与量子力学理论相结合，做出了开创性的工作。其理论贡献如下：一，奇点定理：与罗杰·彭罗斯一起，霍金证明了在广义相对论的框架下，宇宙必然起源于一个“奇点”（一个密度和时空曲率无限大的点），这为现代宇宙大爆炸理论提供了坚实的数学基础。二，霍金辐射：这是他最富盛名的成就。他通过理论计算发现，黑洞并非“只进不出”，而是会因为量子效应在事件视界附近辐射出粒子，从而导致质量损失，最终可能“蒸发”殆尽。这一发现统一了广义相对论、量子力学和热力学，是迈向“量子引力理论”的关键一步。它解决了黑洞热力学中的一个核心矛盾，即黑洞应该有熵和温度，霍金辐射从理论上证明了这一点。三，无边界提议：关于宇宙起源的一个猜想。他认为宇宙的诞生没有所谓的“边界条件”，就像地球的南极一样，是时空的一个平滑点，而非奇点。这是一个深刻的宇宙学思想。

## trading stocks like fishing

we do not know the future like we do not know fish. fish follow nature's clock, not ours. the innate pace of market is unknown to us and it is dynamic, cyclic and interactive between politics, economics and market participants. 

before casting the line, we may study the company's business and the historical data and try to recognize some patterns in the backward. then we try to guess and bet the future of one company. after casting the line, we wait patiently and hope the best because we know and believe time will work out everything for us. that is all you need to know about the trading of stocks.

## [Hitler's playbook](https://phdn.org/archives/www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/osssection3pt1.htm)

His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.

(27) He has the "never say die" spirit. After some of his severest setbacks he has been able to get his immediate associates together and begin making plans for a "come-back". Events which would crush most individuals, at least temporarily, seem to act as stimulants to greater efforts in Hitler.
