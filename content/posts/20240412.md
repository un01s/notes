Each of us has a window, that is ourselves. If we sample fast enough according to Nyquist-Shannon's sampling theorem, we may reconstruct the world viewed through this window. Most of time, our views are just partial and approximate. It's not so even because we are not fast enough and long enough.

It's in vain to recall the past, unless it works some influence upon the present. 
-- Charles Dickens. David Copperfield

```
There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.
-- Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol

I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be.
-- Charles Dickens, Great Expectations

Last winter, I had this idea and started to design and to experiment. At first I'd like its name LEDO (LED origami) and it's close to LEGO. But a quick search revealed that it's taken. Then I'd like to name it Light Origami or Origami Pixel. During the winter, I seldom solder. But it's spring now, the concept has been validated after severl iterations.
