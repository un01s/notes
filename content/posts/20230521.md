## penelope

Her characters are people in a muddle, hopeless cases and outsiders whom she called exterminatees. She does not think that people get what they deserve in this world. Her style is plain, and subtle. She is evasive and reserved. She is inspired by [Ruskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin) and [William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris).

"novels arise out of the shortcomings of history."

"they are all gone into the world of light."

## Cavafy

I have gazed so much on beauty that my eyes overflow with it.

## Borges

When writers die they become books which is after all not too bad an incarnation.

## martin amis

Love is an abstract noun, something nebulous. And yet love turns out to be the only part of us that is solid, as the world turns upside down and the screen goes black.
