## [ugly code](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/2/20/ugly-code/)

> Perfect code doesn't guarantee success if you haven't solved a real problem for real people. Pursuing elegance in a vacuum leads to abandoned side projects or frameworks nobody uses. By contrast, clunky but functional code often comes with just the right compromises for quick iteration. And that in turn means a lot of messy code powers products that people love â€” something that's a far bigger challenge.

> Are you shipping a product and racing to meet user needs? Or are you building a reusable library or framework meant to stand the test of time?

> Both mindsets are valid, but they rarely coexist harmoniously in a single codebase. Flamework is a reminder that messy, simple solutions can be powerful if they solve real problems. Eventually, when the time is right, you can clean it up or rebuild from the ground up.
