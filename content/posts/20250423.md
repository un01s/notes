>> We must be willing to get rid of the life we’ve planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us. -- Joseph Campbell (1904-1987)


>> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, is not an act, but a habit. 我们是我们反复做的事情，卓越不是一种行为，而是一种习惯。亚里士多德（Aristotle）

Just remember that we have everything we need to change our life and the world around us.
