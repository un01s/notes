> We must be willing to get rid of the life we’ve planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us. -- Joseph Campbell (1904-1987)

> The world is full of people suffering from the effects of their own unlived life. They become bitter, critical, or rigid, not because the world is cruel to them, but because they have betrayed their own inner possibilities. The artist who never makes art becomes cynical about those who do.
The lover who never risks loving mocks romance. The thinker who never commits to a philosophy sneers at belief itself. And yet, all of them suffer, because deep down they know: the life they mock is the life they were meant to live. -- Carl Jung

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, is not an act, but a habit. 我们是我们反复做的事情，卓越不是一种行为，而是一种习惯。亚里士多德（Aristotle）

> The only real things in life is the unexpected things. Everything else is just an illusion. -- Watkin Tudor Jones

Just remember that we have everything we need to change our life and the world around us. The world is an abstraction to our minds and it contains two parts, one real and the other imaginative. The real part (the reality) we experince through our senses (the sensed world is just a small part of the reality). The imaginative one we feel with our minds (this only exists in the mind). The world in our mind is both smaller and shorter than the universe (the reality). But it is much bigger that the world we are facing.
