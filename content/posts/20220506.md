At a night with stars, you and I, may see a similar sky.
At a day with sunshine, you and I, may see a different city. 
I am not sure what your city is. My city is so small and it has three grocery stores, two clinics, one children hospital, four schools, one library, two gas stations, a few parks and a river. Three remote cities still in my memory. Plus a few colleagues and friends. These are all of my city. These are my vorld for now.

Learning this world is both directly and indirectly. 

One idea or concept is formed from its ennvironment. Dream and desire too. Unique? Maybe. New? Not really. Like Marcus said long long ago, all that is in accord with you is in accord with me.

Though each of us lives in the same universe, the same planet, we are different.  
Nothing is lost. 
Nothing is created.
Everything is transformed.
