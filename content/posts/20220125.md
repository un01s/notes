* The good and the bad are everywhere all the time. While reading stories and watching movies there are always heroes and villains in these endless dramas. There are always Don Quixote and Sancho. What am I? What are you? A mixture of good and bad. Thatâ€™s all. What if we stop dividing us into black and white?

* One teaching of Budha is now and here. What does it mean? No regret and guilty for the past. No fear and anxiety for the future. Mindfulness is nothing but observing some unnoticed details before. Breath in and breath out. Be there all the time with ones and things you love. The key is your complete focus on the activity you are doing.
