The early warming this year, over 10°C in late Jan and early Feb, might give me a false hope. I might be able to solder something in my garage. So I went ahead to design some PCB and order some components. After lunar new year, they are trickling in one after another, now it is minus 20°C again.

"And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." Right?
