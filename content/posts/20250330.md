## CFG in SSA form

A CFG in SSA form is a representation where each variable is assigned a value only once within the CFG, and each use of a variable refers to the most recent definition, ensuring simpler analysis and optimization.

**CFG**: control flow graph
**SSA**: static single assignment 

A CFG is a graph that represents the control flow of a program. Nodes in the CFG represent basic blocks (sequences of instructions that execute sequentially without branches), and edges represent the possible execution paths between those blocks.

SSA form is a way to represent code where each variable is assigned a value only once within the program’s execution path. This means that each time a variable is assigned a new value, it’s given a new name. This makes it easier for compilers to perform certain optimizations, such as dead code elimination and common subexpression elimination.

To achieve SSA form, compilers often insert special instructions called phi-functions at the join points of the CFG where control flow merges from different paths. Phi-functions select the appropriate value of a variable based on which path was taken to reach that point.

Consider the following example code snippet:

```JavaScript
if (condition) {
  x = 1;
} else {
  x = 2;
}
y = x + 3;
```

In SSA form, the code might look as follows:

```JavaScript
if (condition) {
  x1 = 1;
} else {
  x2 = 2;
}

x3 = phi(x1, x2); // phi function to select the correct value of x
y = x3 + 3;
```
