* 10pm July 2 (Local Time) [百度地图](map.baidu.com)和[必应](bing.com):

After 11-hour cross-pacific from Vancouver to Seoul,then 5-hour to connect, 3-hour to fly, landing around 1150am,home around 0230pm finally, the trip of 19 hours (or 26 hours) was finally done. The worst beer experience, sweating and catching a cold in the on-off sleep during flight.

After a simple late lunch or early dinner around 3pm, then a shower, sleep at 6pm and wake up around 0930pm. Jet-lagging is obvious. How the city is so noisy and everyone seems OK with it? From my window, almost every house has their window open. At night the noise seems the same as day. Or there is no day or night, people is always busy. My brother has to work to 10pm because of my interruption.

The subway is well-connected and slightly hot, at least the cooling is not strong. From route 14 to route 10, then route 8 that is a circle. The subway is not very fast and not very often (not in the peak hours). In the subway, it was not that crowded but almost every adult has a mobile phone in his or her hand. Two phones are quite often. Most are captured by the screens. Exit C. 

So mobile phones and the noise are the first impression. Capturing your face and fingerprints are mandate at the customs without negotiattion. So many stores along the streets. So many cars and vehicles along the street and around the high-rising buildings. It is hot under the sun to walk. Welcome to home.

* 1030pm July 3

Jet lagging is still there. Yesterday fell to sleep around 6pm and woke up arond 9pm. Then it's very hard to fall asleep. Today 730pm and 1130pm. A little better. After a few hour break, fell asleep around 3am and woke up around 7am.

Think to get a local sim card so that a phone number at least.

How to transfer money easily? How to get the kids out? How to avoid normalization? It's very hard. Think about Fang. What he is talking about is all people need here. But he was pushed out. We have one same earth. But there are too many different worlds isolated and connected. Each world has its own set of normalizers.
