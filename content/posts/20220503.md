The leaked draft from the Court is a regression. Hope Amecian people will shoot it down.

Nobody has the right to use your body against your will, event to save your life, or the life of another person. That’s it. That’s the argument.

You cannot be forced to donate blood, or marrow, or organs, even though thousands die every year on waiting lists. They cannot even harvest your organs after your death without your explicit, written, pre-mortem permission.

Denying women the right to abortion means we have less bodily autonomy than a corpse.
