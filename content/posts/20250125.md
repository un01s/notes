Karl Marx (1818-1883): the theorist of capitalism, the historian of economic theory, a great economic theorist. dialectical materialism was Engel's idea.

Analytical Marxists: 
* Gerald Cohen, KARL MARX'S THEORY OF HISTORY, 
* Jan Elster, MAKING SENSE OF MARX

> Robert Wolff:  Marx considers the philosophy of a society to be a part of its ideological superstructure, along with its religion, law, and art, among other things.  Moral judgments are a part of the philosophy and law of a society, hence ideological and superstructural as well.  The fundamental principle of bourgeois justice is that equals be given for equals in a free and open marketplace where men [it is always men] meet one another as legal equals, none compelled by law or custom to enter into bargains with another.  The ideal capitalist, Marx argues, pays a fair price for the labor he employs.  He pays a price equivalent to the reproduction cost of that labor, which, as he and Ricardo would say, is equal to the labor value embodied in that labor.  Now, to be sure, capitalists do not play fair.  As Marx tells us in the great chapter on The Working Day, capitalists try such underhanded tricks, in their effort to extract more value from their workers, as fiddling with the clocks in the factory so as to make the workers labor for a bit longer than the contracted for ten or twelve hours.  But this is not exploitation.  This is just cheating.

> A good deal of Volume One is devoted to discovering how capitalists manage to pull off this trick -- the secret to profit.  Marx's solution -- which, as I have explained at length elsewhere is in my opinion incorrect -- is the distinction between labor and labor power. It is as confused as asking whether, from a bourgeois perspective, feudal laws regulating the making and selling of craft goods are unjust. Exploitation would indeed be unjust in a socialist society, just as exploitation is just in a bourgeois society.
 
David Ricardo (1772-1823), one of the most influential classical economists, along with Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith, and James Mills.

## Marx's thought not Marxism

### background: French revolution, Napoleon's wars and capitalism in England

* Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) & French Revolution (1789-1799)

At that time, France was the wealthiest and most powerful nation in Europe. Continental Europe had not been much troubled by the overthrow and eventual restoration of the Stuarts in England a century earlier, but when the head of Europe's most powerful monarch fell into a basket, people took notice. Napoleon's brief conquests broke up the old Hapsburg Empire and set free cultural and political forces that transformed Central Europe. 1871, Paris Commune.

Napoleon's brief conquests broke up the old Hapsburg Empire and set free cultural and political forces that transformed Central Europe.

* The development of capitalism in England: the explosive rise and expansion of capitalism. Unlike the political revolutions, this transformation matured first in England. Even France, whose highly developed and rationalized economy was still largely agricultural, did not experience the capitalist transformation as early as did England, and in the part of Europe in which Marx was growing up, the economy was still for the most part in a late feudal stage of development.

The Communist Manifesto, 1848, published in London.

1. First of all, there was an explosion of output.
2. "new men": factory owners who had begun life in modest circumstances as apprentices or journeymen, and made money so rapidly that in their own lifetimes they were able to marry their daughters off to impecunious aristocrats or buy themselves titles.
3. the transformation of cities
4. the erosion of the traditional authority and position of the landed aristocracy and the clergy
5. the emergence of a large, literate class of businessmen, merchants, and their families, who became not only a market for the novel, as literary historians have noted, but also a powerful class demanding a real voice in the affairs of government, and prepared to call into question the traditional authority of king, noble, and cleric.
