Find the value of x and y for the following two equations:

$ \sqrt{x} + y = 7 $
$ x + \sqrt{y} = 11 $

My solutuin is based on a guess. From the above, the instinct is that both x and y are the sqaure numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. If we rewrite the equations as follows:

$ \sqrt{x} = 7 - y $
$ \sqrt{y} = 11 -x $
 
This shows that y is less than 7 and x less than 11.

So the hunch is x = 9 and y = 4. Both are the solutions indeed.
